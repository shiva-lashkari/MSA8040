Josh?"
23477,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4392932-domo-inc-domo-ceo-joshua-james-on-q3-2021-results-earnings-call-transcript,Joshua James,"Thank you, Julie. Hello, everyone. Thanks for joining the call. First, I hope that everyone is in good health. As we all know this year has presented unimaginable health and economic challenges across the globe, and we indeed hope this pandemic is a once in a lifetime event., On the call today, I'm going to focus on a few items. First, a huge financial milestone that we've been working for years and the implications for our recent success, increased financial flexibility and our plans to drive efficient revenue growth. Second, our Domo's differentiated platform uniquely positions us to help our customers with their digital transformation initiatives. And third, I'll cover Q3 highlights, including several significant upsells and wins across a variety of industries. And I'll touch on some recent industry recognition., So I'm going to start with sharing how ecstatic I am that we achieved a significant milestone. As of Q3, Domo was a recurring revenue cash flow positive company that has happy customers with gross retention north of 90% and has growing subscription revenue north of 20% with a total annualized revenue run rate of over $200 million. This is the culmination of over a thousand people, including several hundred that are here today, and we have been working on this for over 10 years. This is the culmination of listening to customers and building what they need. This is the culmination of putting our hearts and souls into our customers and our vision, and we are only just getting started., We are the only publicly traded independent cloud-based BI company, and we have countless opportunities in front of us. So a huge thank you to our customers and a huge thank you to our team members, my partners and our investors who have always believed in us., Now we are going to return that belief with greatness. Not many, if any believed we would get to cash flow positive this fast after our IPO two years ago. I put it on the calendar for Q3 fiscal year 2021, and I adamantly believe we would make it one way or another, and despite ups and downs in pandemics, earthquakes, unrest, political upheaval, cuts and losses, great people and wonderful innovative customers banded together to create what is now a world-class organization., I recently put up a billboard that says simply, there's a pony in there somewhere. The reference is from President Ronald Reagan. He often told the story. The story concerns twin boys of five or six. Worried that the boys had developed extreme personalities, one was a total pessimist, the other a total optimist, their parents took them to a psychiatrist., Well, first the psychiatrist treated the pessimist. Trying to brighten his outlook, the psychiatrist took him to a room piled to the ceiling with brand-new toys. But instead of yelping with delight, the little boy burst into tears. 'What's the matter?' the psychiatrist asked, baffled. 'Don't you want to play with any of the toys?' 'Yes, the little boy bawled, but if I did I'd only break them., Next the psychiatrist treated the optimist. Trying to dampen his outlook, the psychiatrist took him to a room piled to the ceiling with horse manure. But instead of wrinkling his nose in disgust, the optimist emitted just the yelp of delight and clambered to the top of the pile, dropped to his knees, and began gleefully digging out scoop after scoop with his bare hands. 'What do you think you're doing?' the psychiatrist asked, just as baffled by the optimist as he had been by the pessimist. 'With all this manure,' the little boy replied, beaming, 'there must be a pony in here somewhere!', Well, I think President Ronald Reagan certainly could have been referring to eternal, but hopefully measured optimism for entrepreneurs. And so for good luck, I put up that billboard at the beginning of this quarter, that repeated that phrase, there's a pony in there somewhere., We've been through our shares of ups and downs, but I was always 100% convinced. This would eventually turn into a fantastic, even world-class company. Maybe it's my entrepreneurial optimism shining through, but we found the pony, a big recurring revenue, fast growing cash flow positive company with all kinds of happy customers, innovations and market positions to go out and capitalize on., Since our IPO, we've been committed to getting to adjust our cash flow positive with the cash on our balance sheet without raising a dime. And I'm thrilled to announce today that in Q3 we achieved it. And in fact, we achieved it with $84 million remaining in the bank substantially more than anyone imagined., In Q3, we posted 25% billings growth, an acceleration from 23% last quarter. The continued growth in our base of recurring revenue and reaching a cash flow positive status gives us increased financial flexibility to pursue the tremendous growth opportunity in front of us., Now, let me talk a little bit about our unique positioning and helping our customers with their digital transformation initiatives. As we all know, what has happened this year has forced companies, their employees, customers, and supply chains to re-imagine how they operate. The need for real-time information, speed and business agility that digital transformation provides has only accelerated. These elements have always been crucial another reason we found at the company. But in this climate, these business priorities have moved to the forefront. Our customers have challenged us to solve their business problems with data at an unprecedented speed and we have delivered for them., Domo's unique platform has three pillars that drive our differentiation. The first is our data integration capabilities to solve back-end integration at cloud scale without moving data. Second is our ability to drive insights and action with AI into well-governed business intelligence power into the hands of business users in an easy-to-use self-service and mobile-first solution. Third is the ability to build data-driven apps in a low-code, no-code way that can modernize business processes at high speed and extend the value of data analytics and insights outside the organization to customers and partners., Our platforms ability to solve at scale and in record time, the back-end and front-end challenges to make data more valuable internally and externally for customers is a huge key to our differentiation. Our most significant wins this quarter were driven by proof-of-concepts, POCs, where we were able to demonstrate our ability to deliver better solutions faster than the competition., The reason we can compose solutions so quickly is part of the inherent flexibility and scalability of the Domo cloud first platform, which brings all the services needed, integration, data management, data science, AI, and machine learning, governance, distribution to citizen, developers and more to the data and apps. Through intelligent analytics-based applications built on the Domo platform in a low-code, no-code environment, we are helping customers to rapidly modernize business processes, leveraging artificial intelligence and automating workflows., Our platform through our Domo Everywhere offering also goes beyond traditional embedded analytics capabilities and enables customers to extend their analytics and the value of their data to external stakeholders, such as customers and supply chain partners, while also generating new revenue models., I'll share a couple examples of this in just a few minutes. Our view is that the demand for speed, business agility and real-time analytics is not something that goes away after the pandemic, and we will continue to deliver this to our customers. Now, let me discuss how we are thinking about our increased financial flexibility and our plans to drive efficient growth., I am particularly proud of how our employees have delivered during the pandemic. I would point out that our recent performance occurred against the backdrop of pretty significant cost reduction this year in a severe economic downturn. Our employee headcount in Q3 was down year-over-year, and we've continued to grow our recurring revenue with [indiscernible] expenses., We have also been relentlessly focused on customer success, which is reflected in our higher retention rates. Going forward, we plan to invest in client services and other areas of our business that directly support our ability to serve and grow existing accounts., So now let me talk about some of the business highlights in Q3. One highlight was the seven-figure annual upsell I mentioned on last quarter's call with the Fortune Global 500 retail conglomerate. We won this deal based on our outperformance and speed and scale compared to the competition. Domo was chosen to help the organization, integrate massive volumes of data from its existing systems without replacing or rearchitecting them, so business decision makers could understand critical time-sensitive business metrics., One of the key factors in our selection was not just Domoâ€™s ability to access and integrate data, but our ability to provide data governance at scale and do so without adding burden to already strained IT teams. Like most large organizations, this customer has multiple related technologies in use, but none were built to perform at cloud scale and in record time, like Domo., Another highlight in the U.S. federal space where we leverage a partner relationship to close and almost seven-figure annual new-logo contract to power PRAC, a public-facing website that gives taxpayers the ability to see and explore pandemic relief spending data. Several of our largest banks in this quarter demonstrate the success of customers having with Domo and how we can grow with the success., For example, we closed a seven-figure upsell with technology and media conglomerate that is using our Domo Everywhere solution to extend the value of its analytics and data and the full power of Domo externally to its community of tens of thousands of partners. We were initially chosen based on our superior speed and scale. This significant expansion was based on the successful rollout to a subset of the company's massive partner network., We also signed a large upsell deal for Domo Everywhere that gives the learning management system, or LMS software company, the ability to embed and monetize LMS analytics into a software solution for its growing customer base. Before the initial contract, this customer had evaluated numerous solutions and also built a homegrown option that just didn't completely fit their vision. After POC, the customer selected Domo because it was the only solution that allowed the company to extend the interactive analytics and data experience it want for your customers at scale., The most recent expansion was driven by the demand the company has seen across the rest of its customer base for its Domo powered analytics, which the company has also turned into a new revenue stream., Now let me talk about some recent industry recognition. Our team continues to receive accolades that reflect our commitment to product innovation, customer success, and our corporate culture. Most recently, Domo with our customer Unilever was named a winner in Ventana Research's Digital Leadership Awards for the support that data and the Domo platform played in Unilever's national philanthropic initiative United for America, which provided them with $25 million worth of support to local communities. In addition, Domo was named an overall experience and credibility leader in the Dresner Advisory Servicesâ€™ 2020 SME BI study. And lastly, Domo was named for the ninth year in a row as a Utah Business best company to work for., In closing, I continue to be impressed by the work our team is doing to help customers thrive, and I am impressed by our employeesâ€™ performance in this environment. Itâ€™s extremely rewarding as well to know we achieved our quarterly results while also hitting the significant milestone of getting the cash flow positive in the quarter with plenty of cash in the bank. And I'm looking forward to continuing to execute on our tremendous growth opportunity. And I sincerely thank our employees for their commitment and I'm so excited to take a moment and celebrate this milestone with them. I am so incredibly proud of all that they've accomplished., And with that, I will turn it over to Bruce. Bruce?"
23477,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4392932-domo-inc-domo-ceo-joshua-james-on-q3-2021-results-earnings-call-transcript,Bruce Felt,"Thank you, Josh. We had a strong Q3 and at the same time, we had several important milestones this quarter. As Josh mentioned, we met our commitments to reach positive operating cash flow without the need to raise additional capital. In fact, we reached this milestone with $84 million in the bank, substantially ahead of our plans at the IPO, and we intend to stay operating cash flow positive going forward., Another milestone is that our gross retention rate increased to over 90% and represents a record high. If the milestone is record subscription gross margins at 81%, an important metric in driving long-term profitability. These achievements are result of many incremental internal improvements we have made across the business enhanced by the market shifting towards solutions such as ours that provide modern ways to create, distribute and use data to run businesses., I will now review the details behind our performance and then discuss fourth quarter and fiscal 2021 full-year guidance. Our Q3 billings of $55.7 million, a year-over-year increase of more than 25% was driven by strong new customer count growth, upsells and expansions and high retention rates. We delivered these results overcoming a tough year-over-year large scale comparison by generating a much higher volume of transactions than one-year ago., At the same time, we've maintained our standard billing terms even against the backdrop of pandemic-driven challenges in seven segments of our customer base. We have 59% of our customers under multi-year contracts at the end of Q3. Our remaining performance obligations, or RPO grew 21% compared to the same quarter last year. Current RPO or RPO expected to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months, grew 22% year-over-year., Q3 total revenue was $53.6 million, a year-over-year increase of 20%. Subscription revenue grew 24% year-over-year and represented 87% of total revenue. International revenue in the quarter represented 24% of total revenue consistent with Q2. Our subscription gross margin was 81% up more than 4 percentage points from 76% in Q3 of last year and a slight improvement from last quarter. We continue to be successful managing our data center costs even as volumes continue to increase., In Q3, operating expenses decreased by 6% from last year, even though revenue increased by 20%. The net effect of increased revenue while being cost efficient, improved our operating margin by 31 percentage points from the same quarter last year., Now let me comment briefly on our investment and margin approach going forward. Now we have hit the milestone of becoming adjusted cash flow positive, we plan to continue to generate positive operating cash flow. At the same time, since we have cushion on the balance sheet and have demonstrated leverage in the business, we believe we can safely take some of that leverage and invest more in growth than we have over the last two years., We are already building our salesforce capacity and plan to make additional investments in some new product areas in order to support our growth plans. We can make these investments continue to expand margins. Although we expect margin improvement to occur at a lesser rate that we have demonstrated recently as we sought to achieve cash flow profitability. We will provide specific guidance and more color around these things when we announce our Q4 results., Our net loss was $11.9 million and our net loss per share was $0.40. This is based on 29.5 million weighted-average shares outstanding, basic and diluted. In Q3, we reported adjusted cash flow from operations of $1.4 million, an improvement of $6.2 million over last quarter., Adjusted cash flow from operations excludes 3.1 million of share purchases in Q3 under our employee stock purchase plan. The amount is included as a positive amount in our GAAP cash flow from financing section of our cash flow statement and an offsetting negative amount in our GAAP cash flow from operations section with no effect on our cash balance., Turning now to our balance sheet. As of October 31, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $84 million. Now to discuss what we expect in Q4 and the full fiscal year of 2021. For Q4, we are expecting billings of about $72 million as we are experiencing strength in our business and have good visibility as we head into the remainder of Q4., For the current fiscal year, we now expect billings of about $222 million, up from $208 million that we guided to last quarter and well above our initial outlook of $190 million based on our COVID-19 downside case that we use for reducing costs., On expenses, we are planning on our Q4 operating expenses to increase modestly from Q3 levels. While we expect to see decrease in operating expenses in fiscal year 2021, we expect them to increase in fiscal year 2022. We expect Q4 adjusted net cash provided by operations of approximately $1.5 million and expect full-year adjusted net cash used in operations of approximately $11 million., Now to formal guidance. For the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021, we expect GAAP revenue to be in the range of $53.3 million to $54.3 million. We expect non-GAAP net loss per share, basic and diluted of $0.42 to $0.46. This assumes 30.1 million weighted average shares outstanding, basic and diluted., For the full-year of fiscal 2021, we expect GAAP revenue to be in the range of $206.6 million to $207.6 million, representing year-over-year growth of 19% to 20%. We expect non-GAAP net loss per share, basic and diluted of $1.83 to $1.87. This assumes 29.3 million weighted average shares outstanding, basic and diluted., In closing, we are pleased with our execution in Q3 and are optimistic about our financial position and growth opportunities as we close out fiscal year 2021 and head into next year., With that, we'll open up the call for questions.
