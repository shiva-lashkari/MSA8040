23477,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4393736-mongodb-inc-mdb-ceo-dev-ittycheria-on-q3-2021-results-earnings-call-transcript,Dev Ittycheria,"Thank you, Brian and thank you to everyone for joining us today. I will start by reviewing our third quarter results before giving you a company update., Looking quickly at our third quarter financial results, we generated revenue of $150.8 million, a 38% year-over-year increase and above the high-end of our guidance. We grew subscription revenue 39% year-over-year. Atlas revenue grew 61% year-over-year and now represents 47% of revenue. And we had another strong quarter of customer growth ending the quarter with over 22,600 customers. We're very pleased by our third quarter performance against a difficult and uncertain macroeconomic backdrop. We saw another record quarter of customer additions both in our direct sales and self-serve channels. As we discussed in the past, given the strong product market fit of Atlas, we decided to make a number of changes that make it easier for new customers to get on to our platform. We continued to reap the benefits of these adjustments in Q3 with record customer growth and strong net ARR expansion. On the self-serve side, our continued efforts to broaden our digital marketing funnel have resulted in over 2,000 net Atlas customer additions in Q3. As a reminder, our self-serve business is increasing not just an important revenue generator in its own right, but also a source of leads for our sales force. Strong self-serve net additions in Q3 indicates that this flywheel effect will continue in the future., I'd like to share some themes we have heard from senior level customers across a large swathe of industries and geographies. Customers are feeling more pressure than ever to innovate quickly to seize new opportunities and to respond to new threats, and 2020 has only exacerbated the need for speed meaningfully increasing the urgency to move to the cloud. When evaluating technologies, customers want solutions that provide a seamless migration path from on-premise to the cloud. They need mission-critical platforms that can massively scale and customers now recognize they have to simplify their tech stack to ensure agility and speed. Furthermore, the resiliency of the computing platforms and the ability to serve customers easily no matter where they are based has never been more important. As a result, customers are fundamentally rethinking their technology strategy and the debate is not if or when, but how to accelerate the modernization of their legacy applications as well as to build new apps to address the new business requirements., Consequently, it is clear the global pandemic is only accelerating the existing trends that are a significant catalyst for our business. These customers don't view us as just another database, but as a core platform to enable them to drive more innovation and growth for their business. Our Q3 results demonstrate that by helping our customers solve their most pressing challenges, our business continues to thrive during a challenging macro backdrop. So what is driving the success and how have we established ourselves as the leading modern general purpose database? Our differentiation comes down to three pillars. The first is technological. We believe that in the end, the best database wins. Databases are at the heart of applications and if the database is hard to use, has performance or scaling issues, the application itself will suffer and so will the business that invested in it. The foundation of our database is the document model, which maps to the way developers think and code and has proven to be the most productive way for developers to work with data. Moreover, our database was built from the ground up with a distributed architecture allowing applications to scale more easily and cost effectively while delivering outstanding performance., Our CTO, Mark Porter, has been in the database industry for over 30 years and he has tried many times in many different organizations to re-engineer relational databases into fault tolerant distributed databases. Due to the underlying limitations of the architecture of relational databases, this becomes a huge challenge to overcome. Instead, we've built a database that's incredibly easy to use, that is applicable for almost every conceivable use case, and is engineered for mission-critical workloads. A large banking customer recently remarked to us that employees steeped in decades of relational orthodoxy are at first curious about MongoDB, but within months become enthusiastic converts to the modern way of building and running applications. Our tech advantage clearly extends to the cloud. The most common go-to-market tactic cloud vendors use is lift and shift, moving on-prem relational workloads to an open source relational database service such as Postgres., After using this approach for a number of workloads, customers soon realized that the expected cost benefits from a cloud deployment are more than offset by the limitation of the underlying architectural constraints of relational databases. In other words, lift and shift is not the same as modernization and customers are increasingly coming to appreciate the distinction between the two. When it comes to customer satisfaction, we just closed the month of November with an NPS score of 74 for Atlas, a remarkably high number, particularly for our category and a clear indicator of how compelling our global cloud platform has become for our customers. We believe we have a fundamentally superior technology and customers are increasingly coming to the same conclusion., Our second pillar of differentiation is developer mind share. Over the course of time, alternative technologies have tried to replace relational databases, but they all failed because of a lack of developer adoption. The founders of MongoDB were developers themselves and intimately understood the challenges that developers faced working with relational databases, especially since a tabular approach bore little resemblance to how data is represented in application code, consequently making relational databases hard to use. Due to its ease of use and flexibility, the document model garnered incredible developer enthusiasm. By every objective measure, MongoDB is the most popular modern database in the world today. Our Community Server, the free to use product, has been downloaded over 130 million times and has been downloaded over 55 million times this year, which is more than the total number of downloads in the first 10 years of the company's history., The MongoDB community of developers is large and global and continues to grow every day. We have spent the last decade plus building that community and that is an asset that is difficult to replicate., Finally, the third pillar of competitive differentiation is increasingly structural and that is platform independence. Having a multi-cloud strategy is a strategic imperative for nearly every enterprise with 85% of enterprises today already using services from multiple cloud providers and the expectation is that this number will grow to 98% over the next three years. Not only do we provide an easy on-ramp to the cloud and run on all major cloud platforms, in the third quarter, we announced the general availability of multi-cloud clusters in Atlas, which enables customers to run an application across multiple public clouds simultaneously., With Atlas moving data, traditionally the hardest piece of an application stack to move, becomes far easier. Running an application across multiple clouds has a number of benefits. The application is more resilient as it is not subject to single-cloud outages, developers can easily leverage the unique capabilities of each cloud provider, and the applications can migrate between clouds with no downtime avoiding vendor lock in. Atlas is the first global cloud database that delivers a true multi-cloud solution. The combination of our unique value proposition and multi-faceted go-to-market model puts us in a great competitive position. We see our strong third quarter and year-to-date results in an unprecedented environment as an indication that our differentiation resonates in the marketplace. The strength in the quarter was broad based across geographies and customer segments., Our self-serve teams continue to rapidly experiment and launch programs to make it easier for customers to find and use MongoDB and our sales teams have remained disciplined about their rigorous pipeline generation and qualification process. We believe we're playing from an increasing position of strength and are well positioned to disproportionately benefit from the move to the cloud., Now, I'd like to spend a few minutes reviewing some customer wins and interesting use cases from the third quarter. Celebrating its 100-year anniversary this year, Pitney Bowes has undergone a multi-year digital transformation resulting in a highly distributed cloud services for the mailing, shipping, and financing needs of its 750,000 plus global clients, including 90% of the Fortune 500. The global technology commerce giant recently standardized its business critical applications on MongoDB Atlas to support its 1 billion plus global e-commerce business., One of the largest telecom providers in the Middle East decided to migrate from Oracle to MongoDB to modernize its legacy mission critical customer loyalty application and deliver a more seamless experience to customers around the world. MongoDB helped the company upgrade its architecture to accommodate the huge volume of new data coming from its digital channels and increase the speed of its application release cycles by a factor of three. Anheuser-Busch InBev, home to several of the world's most recognizable beer brands, chose MongoDB Atlas as the primary database for a proprietary B2B application, BEES. The platform digitizes Anheuser-Busch's relationships with its customers offering convenience, seamless communication, and most importantly, enhanced business performance. The BEES app has been its core revenue driver since COVID-19 started and its user base increased by 40% last quarter., One of the world's largest car manufacturers expanded its usage of MongoDB Atlas to support continued modernization efforts for its North American business. The company was able to standardize its application development and accelerate time to market across all its divisions while scaling to accommodate growing demand across the United States and Canada. Current, a leading U.S. challenger bank serving the needs of people who have been overlooked by the traditional banking industry, has increased their investment in MongoDB Atlas on Google Cloud after a year of exponential growth. They chose MongoDB for our consistent data model, enterprise security with field-level encryption, and multi-document ACID transaction capabilities., In summary, we are very pleased with our performance in Q3. We are executing at a high level, acquiring new customers at a record pace, and deepening relationships with existing customers by building on our core competitive strengths of technical superiority, developer mind share, and platform independence., With that, I'll turn it over to Michael."
23477,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4393736-mongodb-inc-mdb-ceo-dev-ittycheria-on-q3-2021-results-earnings-call-transcript,Michael Gordon,"Thanks, Dev. As mentioned, we delivered another strong performance in the third quarter both financially and operationally. I'll begin with a detailed review of our third quarter results and then finish with our outlook for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2021. First, I'll start with our third quarter results. Total revenue in the quarter was $150.8 million, up 38% year-over-year. Subscription revenue was $144.1 million, up 39% year-over-year and professional services was $6.7 million, up 19% year-over-year., To put our performance in the quarter into perspective, we thought it would be helpful to provide an update on how COVID-19 has impacted the growth of our business. First, let's talk about new business. Our ability to execute on new business opportunities with both new and existing customers continued to surpass our expectations in Q3 despite a difficult and uncertain macro environment. As Dev mentioned, customers are approaching digital transformation and cloud adoption with a heightened sense of urgency, which our go-to-market teams have capitalized on. I want to be clear, even though we performed better than our expectations in terms of new business, COVID-19 did have a negative impact on our quarterly performance., Second, the trend in existing Atlas customer spend has been steadily improving since the modest, but broad based slowdown we experienced in Q1 due to the impact of COVID-19. In Q3, the growth from existing Atlas customers has returned to our pre-COVID trends. Overall, Atlas' strong performance continues to be the largest contributor to our growth. Atlas grew over 61% in the quarter compared to the previous year and now represents 47% of total revenue compared to 40% in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 and 44% last quarter., During the third quarter, we grew our customer base by over 2,400 customers sequentially, bringing our total customer count to over 22,600, which is up from over 15,900 in the year ago period. Of our total customer count, over 2,800 are direct sales customers, which compares to over 1,900 in the year ago period. The growth in our total customer count is being driven in large part by Atlas, which had over 21,100 customers at the end of the quarter compared to over 14,200 in the year ago period. It's important to keep in mind that the growth in our Atlas customer count reflects new customers to MongoDB in addition to existing EA customers adding incremental Atlas workloads., We had another quarter with our net ARR expansion rate above 120%. We ended the quarter with 898 customers with at least $100,000 in ARR and annualized MRR, which is up from 688 in the year ago period. The continued strong growth in customers with $100,000 or more in ARR is an indication of our success of our land and expand go-to-market strategy and the fact that we're increasingly becoming a strategic partner and a database standard for our customers., Moving down the P&L; I'll be discussing our results on a non-GAAP basis, unless otherwise noted. Gross profit in the third quarter was $108.6 million, representing a gross margin of 72%, which is consistent with both last quarter and the year ago period. Overall, we're pleased with our gross margin performance, which reflects greater efficiency and scale in our Atlas business. However, we continue to expect that we'll see some modest reduction in overall company gross margin as Atlas continues to be a bigger portion of our revenue. Our operating loss was $16 million or negative 11% operating margin for the third quarter compared to negative 13% margin in the year ago period. Our outperformance versus our operating loss guidance was driven in part by our revenue outperformance., In addition, we had assumed a partial normalization of travel and facilities expenses due to the gradual reopening economy, but that normalization didn't occur in Q3 and doesn't seem likely in the near-term. While those pandemic related savings are benefiting our bottom line in fiscal '21, we don't expect this to be a sustained benefit. Net loss in the third quarter was $18.2 million or $0.31 per share based on 59.4 million weighted average shares outstanding. This compares to a loss of $0.26 per share on 56.4 million shares outstanding in the year ago period., Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with $966.8 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and restricted cash. Operating cash flow in the third quarter was negative $8.1 million. After taking into consideration approximately $6.8 million in capital expenditures and principal repayments of finance lease liabilities, free cash flow was negative $14.9 million in the quarter. This compares to negative free cash flow of $13.1 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2020., I'd now like to turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter and the full fiscal year 2021. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $155 million to $157 million. We expect non-GAAP loss from operations to be $23 million to $21 million and non-GAAP net loss per share to be in the range of $0.42 to $0.39 based on 60.2 million weighted average shares outstanding. For the full fiscal year 2021, we are increasing our revenue guidance to $574.4 million to $576.4 million. We are improving our profitability expectations and now expect non-GAAP loss from operations to be $56.6 million to $54.6 million and non-GAAP net loss per share to be in the range of $1.07 to $1.04 based on 58.9 million weighted average shares outstanding., Our guidance incorporates an expectation that the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic will impact Q4 and likely continue into fiscal '22. Moreover, we believe that the recent measures implemented in Europe and the U.S. to fight the resurgence of the virus will add uncertainty and volatility to the business environment. Let me explain how this impact is captured in our business outlook., Starting with new business, well so far, we've outperformed our expectations due to strong customer engagement. We do expect to see similar headwinds to our new business activity in Q4. We also face a particularly tough year-over-year comparison in terms of new business because last Q4 was quite strong for our Enterprise Advanced product. Enterprise Advanced has a more immediate impact on revenue due to the fact that under ASC 606, we recognize the term license component upfront. Furthermore, our forecast reflects the compounding impact from the slower than historical growth from our existing Atlas customers that we experienced earlier in the year. Even though growth rates have returned to pre-COVID levels, we experienced several months of slightly lower growth that impacts the base of recurring revenue entering Q4. Lastly, customer cohort behavior and net ARR expansion rates continue to be strong despite the macro challenges as customers increase their investments in our platform., To summarize, MongoDB delivered excellent third quarter results. We're executing well despite operating in an unprecedented environment. We're investing in the business for the long haul and believe that we're well positioned for continued success., With that, we'd like to open it up to questions. Operator?"

During the past few months we've seen a vastly different college experience take place nationwide. Our campus partners have adapted to a fall semester. It looks very different than in years past. Between navigating the late start dates introducing blended learning format implementing widespread student testing and more colleges and universities adjusted as best they could to the ongoing challenges that COVID-19 pandemic continues to present. Through all of this BNED has been able to pivot accordingly ensuring that our customers receive uninterrupted service no matter where, when or how their learning took place this fall., As we have highlighted since the onset of this pandemic the strategic investments we have made in our digital offerings e-commerce solutions warehouse operations and campus stores have uniquely positioned us to offer the flexible and adaptable solutions that institutions students and faculty need., Over the past few years we have introduced solutions such as our BNC First Day model and the BNC Adoption and Insight Portal to drive convenience for students and administrators and respond to institutions increased emphasis on affordability access and achievement. We have also developed a new digital offerings such as our bartleby suite of services to ensure students have access to 24/7 academic support., Coupled with our virtual bookstores dropship offerings and fulfillment capabilities powered by our MBS subsidiary, BNED has created an unmatched value proposition which we believe has become only more relevant in light of the challenges this pandemic has presented for institutions. It is because of this that we have continued to attract new clients and generate new business growth $93 million in new business today this fiscal year or $71 million on a net basis., With that being said, we are continuing to experience the impacts of the pandemic in other areas of our business and our adjusting and adapting accordingly. As anticipated, we experienced substantially lower general merchandise sales this quarter, which significantly impacted our profitability given the relatively high margins of our GM business. Our second quarter traditionally sees higher general merchandise sales due to athletic events many of which were either completely canceled or took place in a reduced capacity this fall. Our field team has done a tremendous job managing expenses to help mitigate these declines, which Tom will discuss further detail., Compared to our expectations, textbooks performed relatively well particularly considering many students did not have the traditional on-campus experience or did not attend on-campus classes at all. Textbook sales declined 19% for the quarter as compared to 7.7% decline in the prior year period. Because of substantially reduced foot traffic on campus and in our campus stores due to pandemic restrictions, eCommerce remains an important and accelerated sales channel for us., We continue to see a large percentage of shoppers purchasing their textbooks and general merchandise on our bookstore website. eCommerce sales represented 56% of our total Q2 sales as compared to just 36% in the prior year. We have made continued progress in the development of our new eCommerce platform this quarter. This exciting platform will provide a hyper personal, hyper local shopping experience for customers., We continue to see growth and momentum of our First Day and First Day Complete inclusive access programs, which has become even more relevant institutions in light of the current learning environment. At a time when many things remain uncertain, our First Day offerings enable schools to provide a more affordable and highly convenient model that ensures students receive their course materials and are ready to learn by the first day of class. This is more critical now than ever., At the start of the fall semester, we successfully launched First Day Complete in 12 campuses and we expect to implement the program at additional campuses for the start of the spring semester. As we look ahead to next fall we are in deep discussions with a significant number of our campus partners about transitioning to First Day Complete as they look to take advantage of the benefits of our -- in all inclusive model to enhance access affordability and student academic achievement., As we continue to support our campus partners to our bookstore operations and course material offerings we also continue to serve students directly through our DSS segment. The demand for bartlebyâ€™s homework health solutions has recently exploded. October 2020 was our highest traffic month ever with approximately 4 million unique visitors in the month up 378% versus last year and up almost 80% versus spring peak traffic., We are focused on scaling this business in a quality manner that will lead to sustainable subscriber growth. Bartlebyâ€™s potential to add significant shareholder value to BNED is truly exciting. The rapid emergence and persistence of online and blended learning format only strengthens the need for this digital solution. This past quarter we saw continued demand for our bartleby products from a studentâ€™s reserve. Bartleby grow subscribers grew to over 120,000 over 120,000 with revenue increasing 53%., On a year-on-date basis subscriber growth is up over 40% because fewer students are on campus right now, we have seen a smaller percentage of bartleby sales taking place through our in-store channel and while our store teams are still putting great effort into selling their customers we've also increased our focus on other sales and marketing channels to ensure that bartleby is available to as many students as possible. This includes SEO which has continuously seen our expectations in driving users to bartleby remains a core aspect of our growth strategy., Additionally during the second quarter we entered into a partnership with Blackboard a leading ed-tech company to offer our bartleby solutions in their newly launched Blackboard assist feature. Blackboard assist as a feature, within Blackboard learning management system that enables higher ed students to search and access academic support services from their institutions as well as from curated third party tutoring and homework tools such as bartleby right within their LMS., Bartleby will offer two products to Blackboard system in the United States. Bartleby help and Bartleby right. Bartleby help is institutionally branded version of our Bartleby Learned product which provides asynchronous online tutoring from experts who are available 24/7. We are very excited about this new partnership and expanded distribution it provides for our bartleby suite of services in the United States. Blackboard learn as a leading global learning management system in the US and serves millions of students many of whom are outside of the BNED footprint., We believe that partnerships such as this one vital source will allow us to grow brand awareness for bartleby in turn driving increased subscriptions and revenue. As we look to further scale our Bartleby suite of solutions, we will continue to explore additional partnerships such as this one, which will allow us to scale at faster rates. This was obviously a very unique fall rush for our stores, for students, for faculty and for our campus partners., With our focus on the health and safety of our people and communities, our stores resumed operations on campuses, where it was deemed safe to do so this fall. Supporting customers with safety measures such as mobile curbside pickup, contactless payments and socially distant store layouts. We are immensely proud of our teams for the ways in which they have adapted to change these past few months., One of our biggest strengths as a company lies in the relationships we have on campuses nationwide. Our partners, students and faculty rely upon us for best-in-class service and even in the midst of a global pandemic, we have been able to continue delivering just that. As we've noted previously, we continue to expect COVID-19 to impact our business throughout this fiscal 2021. In response, we have substantially adapted our cost structure and continue to take actions to reduce costs and operate more efficiently in this environment. We will remain vigilant and highly focused on managing expenses and liquidity prudently., I would like to take this opportunity to once again thank all of our campus partners and our people at BNED, their tireless efforts throughout these challenging times. Even as we have had to adapt to difficult circumstances, our teams have continued to make significant progress on our goals and I'm very proud of the ways in which theyâ€™ve all continued to innovate and move forward. With that, I will turn it over to Tom for the financial review."
23477,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4393631-barnes-noble-education-inc-bned-ceo-mike-huseby-on-q2-2021-results-earnings-call-transcript,Tom Donohue,"Thanks, Mike. Please note that our fiscal 2021 second quarter ended on October 31, 2020 and consisted of 13 weeks. All comparisons will be to the prior-year period unless otherwise noted. Total sales for the quarter were $595.5 million compared with $772.2 million in the prior year. This decrease of 176.7 million or 22.9% was comprised of $165.2 million decrease from the retail segment, a $3.8 million decrease from the wholesale segment and a 0.7 million increase from the DSS segment. BNEDâ€™s fiscal 2021 second quarter results were significantly impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic as many schools continued to adjust their learning model and significantly reduced their on-campus activities in response to the pandemic., While many big conferences resume their sporting activities, fan attendance was either eliminated or severely restricted which had a substantial impact on the company's high-margin general merchandise business. Sales were also affected by overall enrollment declines which were further exacerbated by the decline of international students who either studied online or deferred their studies as a result of the pandemic. Retail comparable store sales declined 28.1% during the quarter comprised of a 19% decline in textbook sales and a 52% decline in our general merchandise business., Our general merchandise business which includes clothing and food, and relies on store traffic throughout the semester was far more impacted by the reduction of students, on campus and the elimination of a campus social events and sporting events. These declines were partially mitigated by BNCâ€™s rapidly growing First Day offerings, which incorporate course material fees into studentsâ€™ tuition fees and grew 77% to $53.4 million during the quarter. Net sales for the Wholesale segment decreased $3.8 million or 9.5% to $36.4 million, primarily due to decreased gross sales, partially offset by lower returns and allowances., DSS sales grew $0.7 million or 14% to $5.9 million, benefiting from the growth in Bartleby subscriptions and our Student Brands business. Bartleby subscriptions revenue increased 53% to $1.7 million, while Student Brandsâ€™ revenue increased 3.8% to $4.3 million. The consolidated gross margin rate for the quarter was 19.4% compared to 24.2% in the prior year period. This decrease was primarily due to the shift to lower margin digital courseware and lower sales of our higher margin general merchandise products, coupled with higher markdowns. This is partially offset by our efforts to negotiate lower contract costs., In anticipation of the challenging sales environment, we continue to prudently manage payroll and store operating expenses. These actions coupled with the cost reduction actions taken in fiscal 2020 enabled us to reduce selling and administrative expenses by $21.4 million or 18.9% compared with the prior year period. As we look ahead to the spring rush period, we anticipate that schools will continue to prioritize the health and safety of their faculty and students and continue to adjust their learning models in response to the pandemic., We expect that they will continue to restrict on campus social events including sporting events to reduce crowds and follow COVID-19 safety protocols. We remain committed to serving our partners how I really choose to resume learning and we'll continue to prudently manage expenses and liquidity in light of the lower sales environment. Due to all the uncertainty that COVID presents in the near and intermediate term we are not providing fiscal 2021 guidance. We do expect that COVID will continue to have a significant impact on our business during fiscal 2021., At the end of the quarter our cash balance was $7.4 million with outstanding borrowings of $99.5 million as compared to $24.6 million of cash and no borrowings in the prior year period. This difference is directly the result of the lower sales environment we are experiencing, but better than our own expectations. Our current liquidity position remains strong despite the challenging climate., CapEx for the second quarter was $9.1 million compared with $10.9 million in the prior year. Currently, our retail segment operates 1,439 college, university and K-12 school bookstores comprised of 768 physical bookstores in their e-commerce sites as well as 671 virtual bookstores. As of today we have contracts to open an additional nine stores in fiscal 2021 with one additional known closing primarily of the smaller unprofitable store. This will bring our total physical and virtual store count to 1,447 locations net of closed stores., With that, we open the call for questions. Operator, please provide instructions for those interested in asking the question."

We are pleased to report another solid quarter as total revenue reached $100 million, up 57% year-over-year in line with our prior guidance. We continued to see healthy demand of our value for money products across the regions where we operate, including North America, Europe and Southeast Asia. , Benefitting from our consistent efforts to optimize our supply chain and product mix, we maintained our gross margin at a healthy level, achieving 43% during the quarter compared with 42% in the same period of last year. We maintained profitability. Net income for the quarter was $7.3 million., Our solid financial performance reflects successful execution of our strategy as we better position ourselves in the intensive and competitive cross-border e-commerce. We relentlessly focused on a number of key initiatives. For example, optimizing product and category mix, enhancing supply chain management and improving customer satisfaction to increase new and repeat purchase on our platform. , First, I will address supply chain management. Benefitting [ph] from our competitive advantages in supply chain has always been pursued ours, , providing overseas consumers with value for money products is the foundation of our business expansion. Therefore, we continued to deepen our relationship with premium suppliers and have steadily increased our order volumes, so as to continuously reduce costs, while ensuring product quality. This cost saving benefit customers, thereby enhancing the competitiveness of our products. , Second, we continue to focus on variety and relevance. Our platform is committed to providing consumers their full range of products, including apparel wholesale, electronics, sports, cars and hobbies products in the center, so as to provide a one-stop shopping experience., In addition, we continue to capitalize on more cross-sell opportunities. Not only does this allow us to customize sales from each shopper, thus increasing customers' lifetime value, but also enhance long-term customer relationships and improves our operational efficiency., Third, while we continue to drive revenue growth, we also maintained a reasonable level of operating expenses. We have built up a healthy and solid foundation for future growth on the heels of achieving 12 [ph] consecutive quarters of GAAP profitability from the third quarter of 2019., Looking ahead, we expect to continue to achieve sustainable and profitable growth. For cross-border e-commerce, the strongest sales season has arrived. We have noticed that also COVID-19 is still highly affecting some countries and regions. Consumer demand for value for money products is still strong. Therefore, we remain optimistic about the holiday season. , I will now turn the call over to Yuanjun to go through the financials for the quarter. , Yuanjun Ye , Thank you, Mr. He, and thank you, everyone, for joining the call. I will now review our financial results for the â€“ of the third quarter. Let me remind you that all numbers quoted are in U.S. dollars. , Total revenue was $100 million, up 67% year-over-year from $59.9 million in the same quarter of 2019. This was mainly driven by strong growth of product sales, which were $95.4 million versus $58.1 million in the same period in 2019 and growth in services and others, which were $4.6 million, increased 161.6% year-over-year., Gross profit was $43.1 million compared with $25.3 million during the same period last year. Gross margin was 43.1% compared with 42.3% in the same quarter of 2019, primarily due to our continued efforts to optimize the supply chain and product mix. , Total operating expenses in the third quarter were $41.5 million compared with $25.7 million during the same quarter of 2019. The increase was primarily due to an increase in selling and marketing expenses., Operating expenses, fulfillment expenses were $6.7 million compared with $6.8 million in the same quarter of 2019. As a percentage of total revenues, fulfillment expenses were 6.7% compared with 11.3% in the same quarter of 2019 and 6.5% in the second quarter of 2020., Selling and marketing expenses were $26.9 million compared with $12.4 million in the same quarter of 2019.

Included in the G&A expenses, R&D expenses were $3.5 million compared with $4.9 million in the same quarter of 2019 and $3.3 million in the second quarter of 2020., Adjusted EBITDA, which represents a gain or loss from operations before the share-based compensation expense, change in fair value of convertible promissory notes, interest income, interest expense, income tax expense and depreciation and amortization expenses, was $12.7 million in the third quarter of 2020 compared with $0.5 million in the same quarter of 2019., Net income was $7.3 million compared with $10 million in the same quarter of 2019. Net income per ADS was $0.07 compared with $0.15 in the same quarter of 2019. , As of September 30, 2020, we had a cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash of $48.2 million compared with $55 million as of June 30, 2020., For the fourth quarter of 2020, based on current information available and business seasonality, we expect net revenues to be between $120 million and $135 million, representing a growth rate between 61% and 81% compared with the fourth quarter of 2019., This concludes our prepared remarks.

23477,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4392903-idt-corporations-idt-ceo-shmuel-jonas-on-q1-2021-results-earnings-call-transcript,Shmuel Jonas,"Thank you, operator. Welcome to IDTâ€™s first quarter fiscal year 2021 earnings call, covering results for the three months ended October 31, 2020. I'm joined today on the call by Marcelo Fisher, IDTâ€™s Chief Financial Officer. For a detailed report on our financial and operational results, please read our earnings release filed earlier today in our Form 10-Q, which we expect to file with the SEC on December 10., Starting this quarter, we are disclosing our financial results in new reportable segments that more accurately reflect management's current view of the business and increasingly important contributions of our higher growth, higher margin businesses. Please see the earnings release for description of our new reporting segments., This was another strong financial quarter for IDT, with substantial year-over-year improvement in revenue less direct cost of revenue and bottom line results. All three of our high growth, higher margin businesses; BOSS Revolution Money Transfer, NRS and net2phone's cloud communications offerings generated impressive year-over-year revenue growth. In aggregate, these businesses have been contributing an increasing share of our consolidated revenue less direct cost of revenue, and this quarter their contribution topped 30%. Our money transfer business benefited, although significantly less this quarter from the same favorable foreign exchange market conditions that boosted our money transfer results last quarter., Within the new FinTech segment, BOSS Revolution Money Transfer revenue increased by $8 million to $15 million, driven by a 77% year-over-year increase in digital transaction volumes. Also within FinTech, NRS revenues increased 109% to $4.9 million, with payment processing and digital out-of-home advertising revenue leading the way., The COVID-19 pandemic has definitely impacted consumer spending patterns and many local convenience stores are benefiting from increased foot traffic. I am more excited than ever about the potential of our NRS business. Our most promising offerings, including advertising, payment processing and analytics have just begun to realize their potential. And we continue to grow our retail network, adding 450 to 500 new POS terminals a month., We expect the pace of growth to accelerate once COVID vaccines are widely available. By the end of the quarter, we were billing for over 12,000 deployed terminals. net2phoneâ€™s cloud communications business, now reported as the net2phone-UCaaS segment increased revenue by one-third compared to the year ago quarter to $9.6 million. I was particularly happy to see strong sequential growth in our Latin American markets. Many of these markets slowed early in the year as a result of COVID-19. LATAM subscription revenue increased 30% sequentially and our business there should benefit from expansion to new markets going forward., We also recently launched in Peru, the sixth largest market in Latin America and we will add six more cities in Brazil before the end of the current second quarter. So as you can hear and see, we are investing heavily in sales growth. We also continue to invest aggressively in product development and weâ€™re confident that this will position net2phone for an even more impressive growth going forward., Turning now to our Traditional Communication segment, BOSS Revolution Calling and Mobile Top-Up both had a good quarter continuing the trend since the onset of COVID-19 pandemic. While our carrier services business continued to be impacted by the pandemic related loss of international corporate voice traffic, in aggregate revenue for this segment decreased by $10 million to $314 million, while adjusted EBITDA less CapEx a reasonable proxy for cash generated increased by $4.8 million to $17.8 million. Cash generation was boosted by our ongoing efforts to streamline operations and reduce the overhead associated with these offerings., Across our businesses, we continue to invest to develop new technology driven offerings and features that will enable us to better serve and maintain our customers and to pursue exciting growth opportunities as well as systems that make us more efficient. , Within FinTech, we will roll out BOSS Money Visa Card in peer-to-peer transfers early next year. This is the first step in a broader and strategic challenger bank initiative that we are now focusing on to help our immigrant under-banked and unbanked customers conveniently access and participate fully in the digital economy., At NRS, we launched NRS Petro in the first quarter, a new Pay at the Pump Solution for independent gas station owners that we believe will open a potentially large new market for us in both petro and convenience, and food stores that are located in gas stations. And now can use a seamlessly integrated solution from NRS. At net2phone-UCaaS, we continue to focus on developing and releasing integrations with third-party applications and CRMs. Last quarter, we released an integration with Microsoft Teams, since then we have released integrations with Zoho and Slack. Our customers love these integrations, and we expect that these along with other terrific new features in the development pipeline will fuel net2phoneâ€™s expansion in the coming year and beyond., IDT closed the quarter with a stronger balance sheet, even as we continue to invest in our businesses and repurchase our stock. At October 31, we held $119 million in cash, debt securities and current equity investments. Now Marcelo and I would be happy to take your questions."
23477,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4392859-union-pacific-corporation-unp-ceo-lance-fritz-presents-credit-suisse-8th-annual-virtual,Operator,"Allison Landry, Good morning, very pleased this morning to have Union Pacific with us. We have the CEO, Lance Fritz and Brad Stock from Investor Relations. Lance, I'm going to turn it over to you. I know you had a few comments and then we can dive right into the Q&A."
23477,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4392859-union-pacific-corporation-unp-ceo-lance-fritz-presents-credit-suisse-8th-annual-virtual,Lance Fritz,"Great. Thanks Ray. Thank you, Allison. And thank you very much for hosting us this morning. I do have a few comments that we're going to go through; Ray will handle the slides for me. You'll see the slides accompany my comments on this video chat. But they're also available it can be found on our investor website, thanks to the webcast for this event. And before we start, I want to remind everybody that I'm going to be making some forward looking statements. Those statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. So please refer to our website and SEC filings for additional information about our risks. So let's get started on slide 3, our fourth quarter volumes have remained pretty steady through the quarter around 160,000 weekly loads, which is on pace with what we expected when we finished the third quarter., But Thanksgiving last week and Christmas and New Year's coming up. We do expect to see the normal sequential seasonal impact for volumes this month. Fourth quarter volumes are currently up about 3% year-over-year, as we continue to see growth in the premium sector and improving sequential volumes in both bulk and industrial products. Looking a little deeper each business team premiums currently up 10% versus fourth quarter 2019 that's driven by growth in our intermodal business which is up 14%. Intermodal volumes continue to be led by ecommerce or parcel and inventory restocking that spurred by the holiday shopping season., Automotive volumes are only down 2% quarter-to-date, and that shows a slow industry recovery on their part. Our coal businesses flat as coal continues to be a headwind down around 17% quarter-to-date. However, that's been mostly offset by grain exports as grain and grain products are up 18%. Finally, our industrial businesses down 6% demonstrating some sequential improvement while energy markets remain challenged with crude and sand down 40% and 25% respectively. A strong housing market is driving our forest products line up 10%. , Let's go to slide 4. We continue to make improvements across nearly all of our operating metrics striking the right balance between service and efficiency. In the fourth quarter locomotive and workforce productivity have improved sequentially from the third quarter as we see those resources being used more efficiently. That productivity has been driven by in part by continue to improvement in train line with November's number up to over 9,000 or 9,200 feet. This improvement is especially impressive given that sequential volumes are essentially flat., Finally, and most importantly, we continue to provide our customers with an enhanced service product. Manifest service remains fluid and on time while our intermodal services recovered strong as evidenced but 82% on time performance so far in the fourth quarter., Turning to slide 5. By transforming our operating model, we're providing our customers with a more reliable and consistent service product and also reducing our overall cost structure. This combination is opening up new markets and opportunities for us to secure new business. While the uneven nature of the volumes this year has clouded the impact of our business wins. They are now starting to become more evident. As we've mentioned before, we've secured new car loading across a number of our business lines. In grain, tomato paste, sweeteners, pipe, domestic intermodal and international intermodal, just to name a few. We're also bringing new products to market as well. We recently announced the opening of the Union Pacific Twin Cities intermodal terminal featuring domestic intermodal service between the Twin Cities in Los Angeles. This new alternative will give regional shippers and receivers fast, direct and reliable intermodal service to key markets. Our marketing and sales organizations are excited about the products and their selling. And these wins only increase our optimism for the long-term potential of our franchise., Going to slide 6, at Union Pacific we recognize the importance of delivering value for all of our stakeholders. The United Nations has adopted 17 sustainability development goals with a target date of completion by 2030. While, Union Pacific has a role to play in all 17, we're focusing on just 7. I want to quickly highlight some goals that we've set for ourselves to make a difference. At Union Pacific, we're taking aggressive steps to remove barriers for women in our traditionally male dominated industry. Today, women make up approximately 5.6% of our workforce. But by 2030, we have a goal to double that to 11%. Additionally, we recently set a goal for 40% minority representation in Union Pacific by 2030. That's an 11 percentage point increase from today, we believe our company's performance is improved and strengthened with a diverse and inclusive workforce., Speaking of the great UP workforce; we recently announced that we're providing monetary recognition to our agreement professionals in the form of a $1,000 bonus in December, which adds around $37 million to our compensation and benefits line for the fourth quarter. Our agreement employees have been on the frontlines of the pandemic, providing an essential service to the country. Quite literally, these employees have kept the country moving when we needed it most. They went above and beyond take great care of our customers. So this recognition is incredibly well deserved., Finally, in March, we announced our intention to set science based targets to help us further reduce our emissions. We're in the final stages of verification of our proposed started, and we anticipate publishing it in the very near future. That's an important step toward a more sustainable future., Let's go to slide 7, two months into the quarter. Our thoughts on the fourth quarter and full year 2020 remain unchanged for what we discussed in our third quarter earnings call. Volumes have played out pretty much consistent with our expectations heading into the quarter. So we still expect fourth quarter volumes to be up low single digits with full year volumes down 7% or so. Our full year expectation for productivity is to exceed $700 million. And our long-standing guidance on pricing remains unchanged. We expect the total dollars generated from our pricing actions to exceed rail inflation costs. And while fuel prices have risen a little since October, our expectations for volume, price and productivity should produce a record 2020 operating ratio., We expect a full year operating ratio which will improve by roughly a percentage point and start with a five. Longer term, our guidance of capital expenditures of less than 15% of revenue, a dividend payout ratio between 40% and 45% of earnings and ultimately a 55% operating ratio remain intact. , So with that Allison, I will turn it over to you and get into Q&A."

23477,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4392571-regeneron-pharmaceuticals-incs-regn-management-presents-piper-sandler-32nd-annual-virtual,Chris Raymond,"Okay. Let's go ahead and get started. Thanks, everybody, for joining us. My name is Chris Raymond. I'm one of Piper Sandler's Biotech analysts. Pleased to have with us our next presenter, which is Regeneron Pharmaceuticals. We have joining us today, Regeneron's CFO, Bob Landry; and also Justin Holko, who is the VP of Investor Relations. So we've got a lot to talk about in this fireside chat format. We have about 25 minutes. So I think what we're going to have Bob do is to provide just some introductory comments, and then we'll dive into questions., So Bob, please take it away."
23477,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4392571-regeneron-pharmaceuticals-incs-regn-management-presents-piper-sandler-32nd-annual-virtual,Robert Landry,"Great, Chris. Good morning. Nice to see you, and good morning and good afternoon to everyone who's joined us today. Thank you for inviting us to your conference., So before I begin, let me start with some introductory comments. Let me remind you that today there will be remarks on the webcast that will include forward-looking statements by Regeneron and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially. Everyone â€“ everybody knows a complete description of these and other material risks can be found in Regeneron's SEC filings, including its recently filed third quarter 10-Q and then certainly our year-end 10-K. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. So very good., So again, good morning and good afternoon, everyone. Just some opening comments with regards to what's happening at Regeneron, and then Chris and I will get into dialogue on a bunch of different questions. So as we look to close out 2020, we, as a management team, are very proud of our 2020 accomplishments. I'm going to highlight a few recent events. And I know it feels like â€“ it certainly feels like within the â€“ within Regeneron, it's all been about COVID-19 in the environment and where we are. And sometimes, Justin and I think that what gets missed is everything else that's happening contiguous with that., And with me, starting with our double-digit growth on both top and bottom line for the past few quarters, particularly with regards to our third quarter, which showed a year-over-year revenue increase of plus 32% and 25% with regards to EPS. Our growth is being attributable to our increasing diversified revenue and cash flow streams, particularly driven by Dupixent in the alliance profitability., Our pipeline, despite COVID-19, is advancing across all stages. With regards to Dupixent, we've started or will start shortly robust clinical programs in Phase 3 trials for eight potential new indications we announced with Sanofi at the end of Q3, an additional three new indications and they're all going to be Phase 3. These are in process now or starting very soon., We also announced earlier this week that Dupixent has been approved at by the EU as the first and only biologic medicine for children aged six to 11 years with severe AD. As you know, U.S. approval came earlier in the year. In October, we announced a Phase 3 Dupixent trial met its primary and all key secondary endpoints in children age six to 11 years with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe asthma. Now again, we look to file that in the first quarter of 2021 for both the U.S. and EU., And additionally, the FDA granted breakthrough designation recently for the treatment of patients 12 years and older with EoE. We expect to report results from Part B of the Phase 3 trial study in 2022, and that's progressing nicely., We filed Libtayo's BLA for non-small cell lung mono in BCC, and we received priority review and anxiously awaiting the PDUFA, which is going to come at the end of February and early March [Technical Difficulty] on CSCC. Very, very shortly, we're going to be presenting data at ASH. We have an event â€“ an investor event on Monday, December 7 at 4:30 p.m. So I encourage people to attend that if they do have a [Technical Difficulty]., And just as a general note, we don't talk about this a lot, but certainly, next year, you'll see it. As you know, this year, as we close out, I mean, we've brought more INDs into the clinic than we ever have before. And for the first time, it's not just kind of the all organic Regeneron INDs. We are bringing collaborative INDs into the clinic. And if we have time, Chris and I will talk to that., Let me conclude by just saying, our fight against infectious disease is to kind of get everybody up to speed. Our COVID cocktail was granted in EUA for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in adults and pediatrics who are SARS-CoV-2 positive and are at high risk for progressing the severe COVID-19 indoor hospitalization. And we are right now, you saw a little bit of it in the third quarter, we're in the process of delivering batches to BARDA under our $450 million supply agreement while having also executed a global supply agreement with Roche over the summer. And I'm sure Chris and I will get into that., And as we get into 2021, particularly the early part of 2021, new product launches, right? I mentioned Libtayo, non-small cell lung BCC, very exciting. We'll be doing evinacumab, a rare disease in HoFH. We're also going to get an additional indication in Praluent, hopefully for that. And then we will have the Dupixent in pediatric asthma in the later half of the year on that., So just a lot going positive momentum. I know there has been a lot of focus on COVID-19. It's fun to talk about. We're very proud on what we're doing. But certainly, Justin and I want to make sure that everything else doesn't get missed in the midst of what's currently going on., So, Chris, that was my quick couple of minutes. I'll hand it back to you for your opening question."
23477,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4392571-regeneron-pharmaceuticals-incs-regn-management-presents-piper-sandler-32nd-annual-virtual,Chris Raymond,"Great. Yes. And so clearly, a lot going on, and we could probably talk for a couple of hours, but I think we've got about 20 minutes left here. So I'm going to try to pack as much as I can into the time we've got. So thanks for that intro, Bob. And I guess, I do think it's important that we get into a lot of the P&L drivers, but there has been just â€“ as you can imagine, just a ton of attention on Regeneron CoV-2., So maybe we'll start there and just try to understand a little bit about the P&L impact, I guess, to the extent that we can. I know you haven't guided to it. But just trying to set the table. So you have EUA and you're targeting 300,000 doses. I know that's all sort of part of the BARDA contract, the 300,000 doses by the end of January. And then what you guided to is with Roche, you'll have 2 million doses, at least, I think, by the â€“ in 2021. So just on the economics, walk us through the mechanics., I get this question from folks. We tried to spitball what the impact would be next year and we got a lot of questions from investors on this. Just walk through the mechanics of the profit split with Roche? I know some of that depends on when their production capacity ramps and ex-U.S. approvals come online? But in general terms, walk us through the mechanics there."
23477,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4392571-regeneron-pharmaceuticals-incs-regn-management-presents-piper-sandler-32nd-annual-virtual,Robert Landry,"Sure. Let me give you some background. So, our agreement that we executed this summer, I mean, was necessary to help us shore up the capacity concerns by bringing this product into the fold. Roche, as you know, I mean, they have great capability. And they'll be responsible for manufacturing and supplying the cocktail in ex-U.S. markets, Regeneron will provide the cocktail in the U.S. The deal and it's still â€“ I would say, the amount of doses that may come out of this is still in flux., As of right now, I mean, we've reported that we expect to do a minimum of 2 million doses annually while providing Regeneron with the favorable economics. And under the agreement, once Roche is approved for sale, either in the U.S. or EU, they were each required to manufacture product at a minimum committed capacity. We're at 40,000 liters. They're at 100,000 liters. We're then going to allocate the total output, 50 to 50. So if we're short in the U.S. with regards to output because we have the U.S. market, we will use some of their capacity in order to meet the demands in the U.S., And as we've stated, and I know this is a generality, and Justin and I will work either sometime in January or maybe during our February earnings call to provide more information, because I do think it's a little asymmetric in terms of how the profit is going to work. But we've said publicly that we're going to recognize 50% to 60% of the global profits from the collaboration. And again, those levels can fluctuate., So the more we do, the higher our share will be. But based upon the 40,000 liters and the 100,000 liters, how that splits up, I mean, we do expect to get 50% to 60% of the global profits. And Chris, this is still being worked in terms of how it's going to be accounted for, certainly, the part in the U.S. We'll probably report that as net sales., And then the piece that comes in on the ex-U.S., gross profit will be a consideration of another collaboration. So in addition to the Bayer collaboration, the Sanofi collaboration, you'll look to find a Roche collaboration. And we'll make sure that everybody is clear in terms of the modeling on that., We continue, Chris, to work like heck to try to find additional capacity. We've talked about this a lot. I mean, the U.S. production right now is going to be done in the U.S. We are trying to move things around to get this up and running in our Raheen facility. We think that that's possible and we're hoping to kind of do better than the 2 million doses that we've already put on the table. So kind of more to come on that."
23477,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4392571-regeneron-pharmaceuticals-incs-regn-management-presents-piper-sandler-32nd-annual-virtual,Chris Raymond,"Yes. And I guess, that was the next question I was going to ask is, you said before that you're not stopping at the 2 million doses and you're trying. So is there some timeframe that we should look for more clarity on that â€“ on those efforts to increase capacity?, Robert Landry, Yes. I think each time, we formally read out will refresh in terms of where we are. If we're confident on putting more capacity and then we'll do it, some of it is making sure that the Catalents of the world are set to with regards, so we can make the drug substance, but we also need to ensure that it gets properly filled. And we'll also rely possibly on Roche a little bit for the filling of that. So there's a lot of things in flux., And as we know more, I mean, we'll read out more. What's for sure right now is that 300,000 doses have been or will be delivered to the government by the end of January. Some of it was already occurred in October â€“ sorry, some of it already occurred in the third quarter, $40 million. We'll get more of it by the end of the year, and then some of it will drip into the first quarter of 2021."
23477,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4392571-regeneron-pharmaceuticals-incs-regn-management-presents-piper-sandler-32nd-annual-virtual,Chris Raymond,"And so one of the other key questions I get that I know is not totally answerable right now is the long-term opportunity of this asset. And just â€“ so I know George has talked about a need for something like this even post-vaccine. But the question that's often posed is, how do we think about past the acute phase of the pandemic, say, in two to three years after a vaccine has been rolled out, you'll have, for example, potentially some durability issues with folks who've been vaccinated. There will be those who haven't been vaccinated and infected. Have you guys â€“ I know this question is posed to you. But we've looked at Tamiflu as like an interesting maybe comp to this, is that a fair way of looking at it, Bob?, Robert Landry, Yes. I mean, lots to be written here. And then let me start by kind of kudos being an ex-Pfizer guy. Kudos to Pfizer and Moderna on the progress they've made. I mean, it's fantastic. And we â€“ company or couldn't be prouder of those two organizations., As we go forward on the durability, right now, we've spoken that not only can our antibody serve as a bridge to a vaccine, and that's what we're hyping kind of in the summer. But I mean â€“ we think the vaccine is going to take time to reach the masses and that the cocktail is going to be able to coexist longer-term with a vaccine., You're going to have patients who are just not going to want to get vaccinated. I mean, we see that now with regards to flu, the amount of anti-vaxxers, which â€“ I mean, that's fine. You'll find patients who just do not mount an effective immune response and require it and will require a treatment if infected in patients whose immunity wears off and requires treatment once they get infected. So more is to be kind of written here., I mean, we have data that's been published from our ambulatory study. We need to see what's going to come out of the additional studies in terms of what this could be. But management here is confident that this will not be kind of a one and done, Chris, that this will have somewhat of a tail. I mean how big of a tail, just not exactly sure. But even if you take the number of people in the U.S. and the efficacy on the vaccines, that still leaves a lot of people whether 90% or 95% on the 330 million population, I mean, that leaves a lot of people that just this product won't be effective for., And then you add into that, kind of all the anti-vaxxers and all the people that are just kind of wait given the new modality on what Pfizer and Moderna is launching. So we think it's going to have some lengths, just how big a length it's going to have, that's kind of anyone's guess as of right now."
23477,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4392571-regeneron-pharmaceuticals-incs-regn-management-presents-piper-sandler-32nd-annual-virtual,Chris Raymond,"Fair enough. All right. Let's jump into some of the other stuff going on. To your point, Bob, there's more than just the COVID program. So EYLEA, obviously, the biggest driver of the P&L. I want to talk a little bit about that business. So we had an interesting call with representatives of U.S. retina, which was one of your larger customers, I think, last month. And their perspective on the U.S. market, at least, the retina market, with respect to biosimilars, was a little tepid and surprisingly so to me. Their willingness to adopt â€“ I think our impression is that retinal specialists are easy, fast adopters of new technology or of entrance to the market., And so a lot of investors I've talked to have sort of projected that kind of mindset on to adoption of biosimilars, but the feedback we've gotten been very different. And it's not just U.S. retina. We've gotten this from other sources. Just generally speaking, how are you guys viewing next yearâ€™s Lucentisâ€™ loss of exclusivity potentially? How are you guys viewing the â€“ this impact on the market, biosimilars, specifically?"
23477,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4392571-regeneron-pharmaceuticals-incs-regn-management-presents-piper-sandler-32nd-annual-virtual,Robert Landry,"Yes. Chris, I â€“ within that note, I remember something that you said, the sage advice you gave that biosimilars are not bioidenticals, which I think is really true, and it's getting to the point. So leading into the Bayview launch, I mean, we kept kind of pounding the table that safety is going to matter. We've been injected in 30 million eyes, and there was still a lot of emotion and a lot of hype leading into that and unfortunately, for patients that hasn't played out particularly well. But there were interesting facts that were learned from that experience., And I would say they are probably relearned with the top learning be that it was reinforced that safety was, is and always will remain incredibly important to the marketing should never be taken as a given. Even with EYLEA 2 is very astute in ophthalmology with regards to Novartis coming to market and the issues that they had. And then not only with brolucizumab, but we also saw that shortly thereafter with regards to the rejection of Safety really, really matters. And unlike other markets where kind of biosimilars are coming, I mean, the wet AMD and DME markets are quite unique. They have the use of kind of off-label Avastin. And we've always said that that's a low-priced option that has gone head-to-head with us since our launch back in November 2012, they've been a really formidable flow., I'm proud to say that we continue to take market share from them. But that price has always been out there from them. So again, we think that all this is going to limit the impact of biosimilars that could enter the market, given the price differentials that are out there. And then biosimilars provide no opportunity for improved efficacy, while there may be a risk of issues due to differences in the final product. And we try to tell people don't lose sight of PFS in bios, right? So a biosimilar comes with a vial. The PFS has been hugely advantageous in the middle of COVID-19. All the dock practices have adopted back now to the PFS now that both in the branded products around that., And it took us like six years to get to a PFS. So we're going to see whether people are going to go back in time with regards to biosimilars and vials and having to do the injections and the double touch and the triple touch and all that stuff. So I and I think the company kind of agrees with the piece that you put out in terms of whether KOLs are thinking."
23477,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4392571-regeneron-pharmaceuticals-incs-regn-management-presents-piper-sandler-32nd-annual-virtual,Chris Raymond,"So I guess, just in terms of EYLEA's sort of life cycle, if you will. Obviously, there's a ton of them players that are trying to extend the dose, right? You've got Kodiak out there. There are other players. With approaches that aim to not just improve on the efficacy arm, but to extend dose. And I know you've got the EYLEA high dose program to take dosing up to 12 weeks or 16 weeks, but just some of these programs extend further than that. And I guess what gives you guys confidence that in the midst of all these other players that are trying to â€“ as I mentioned, extend the dose interval a little bit more meaningfully than your program, where is the confidence that, that moat, if you will, around EYLEA is formidable enough to sort of maintain the dominance that you guys have?, Robert Landry, Yeah, Chris, I mean, given the size of this category, I mean we feel forever plagued by competition, some good, some not so good, some really early in its life stages, some with really untested new modalities or coming out with modalities that like ag 2 that we've kind of tested before. I mean, we'll see what the science shows them on that end that wasn't successful. So I mean, there's a lot out there, and I certainly don't want to get into individual products that are coming. I mean our statute is â€“ I mean, we still consider â€“ if you look at my five year strat plan that EYLEA is going to continue to be a growth pillar, Chris, moving forward., I mean, we could argue with regards to the amount of share we're going to take and how big the market is going to get. But everything still points to really significant opportunity in 2021 and beyond. I mean, favorable demographics. I mean, we've had that tailwind for a while, aging population, increasing in diabetes, our efficacy, safety and convenience profile. I mean, that stays consistent and it is second to none. We continue, and we can talk about this, continue to make market penetration opportunities in diabetic eye disease. It's something that since Marion has been on board the last two years, we have changed around our sales force to specifically go after this indication., We were making good headway into this indication by taking more share. It remains a big time untapped market for us. It's just hard to get at. We were making good progress on it, along comes COVID-19. And certainly, what we found is some of the first patients that stopped coming to visits to the docsâ€™ offices were diabetic disease patients. And we've done a good job in Q3 on getting them back into the office, but that still remains a real growth opportunity for us in addition to, like I said, the tailwind on the demographics."
23477,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4392571-regeneron-pharmaceuticals-incs-regn-management-presents-piper-sandler-32nd-annual-virtual,Chris Raymond,"So I got about 10 more questions and we have just in the interest of time, I think we'll move on. So one question on Dupixent. So our checks have suggested that dermatologists are pretty wary of the safety profile of JAKs. And we've done a number of surveys and the feedback is relatively consistent that there's some â€“ this is not something that's going to be embraced wholeheartedly. And these are obviously being evaluated in atopic dermatitis. But I guess later this year, there should be a Phase 3 readout of head-to-head trial of Dupixent versus Rinvoq. How do you see that competitive landscape evolving? I know there's a bias right now, but just in terms of sort of war gaming, the potential outcomes and the impact from that â€“ from, I would argue Rinvoq or other players in the ad space?, Robert Landry, Yeah. I mean, we've kind of opened up a gigantic market, which there's still a lot to be had on the ad marketplace, Chris. Pfizer and AbbVie, who are very strong flows will be entering the marketplace. You'll have their challenges, certainly with regards to the JAKs issues that has kind of plagued that class. Data has come out recently. It was kind of confirmatory on Phase 2. Nothing was â€“ nothing had changed with regards to safety signals, the same safety issues that were there in Phase 2 seem to be there in Phase 3 in recent reports., We sense and what we hear from KOLs and scientific advisers is that JAKs will be relegated to use in later lines of treatment after Dupixent. As you know, derm docs, I mean new calls are hypersensitive to safety, particularly when there's an effective safe agent out there. I mean we've dosed 200,000 patients already. Our safety profile is really, really clean. We've done, I think, more than 10,000 patients across 50 clinical trials where we've studied this., So we're going to have a leg up. We're going to have a leg up with regards to the safety data set that we have. They're going to require maybe Black Box warning associated. They're going to require lab monitoring. You have to question with regards to adolescents and feeds in terms of kids, you're going to be able to kind of give JAKs to younger people, particularly for chronic therapies. A lot was made early on with regards to the injectable. We've launched the 300 mg auto-injector. We're launching a 200 mg auto-injector, things you need to do necessary as a leader in the category. So I think the whole injection oral storyline, that's long gone, particularly with these friendly injectors., And Chris, probably most important is, and we've mentioned this a lot is the comorbidity issue, right, where it's just proven to be tremendously effective. I started off in my opening comments about we're going into eight additional Phase 3 indications associated with it, let alone the asthma and kind of the polinization that, unfortunately, these people with regards to Type 2, it's not just Dupixent that they have and that is a big one up on our competitors."

I've got a ton more questions, but I think we're just about out of time here. So Bob and Justin, I wanted to get to so much more stuff. Fortunately, we ran out of time.

Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining our third quarter 2020 earnings conference call., During the third quarter, total net revenue were RMB239.4 million, which, as anticipated, met our previously announced guidance. Gross profit margin further grew to 72.9% from 71.9% in the previous quarter. With the adjustments we made since the previous quarter, we have seen a constant flow of positive effects on our newly streamlined operations. That could be seen in our net loss, which was further narrowed to RMB70.6 million, a 23.6% improvement quarter-over-quarter., During the quarter, we continued to maintain prudent cost control on advertising expenditures and our user acquisition costs. Our overall user growth was impacted by this approach and gross billing declined â€“ declined 16.1% sequentially. However, gross billings of our Kids business managed to improve by 56.5% compared with the previous quarter., With that quick financial overview, I would now like to provide an update on our product mix and the strategic growth plan, and then Bing, our CFO, will discuss our operations and financial further in a few minutes., Let's start with our Adult business. With our DongNi series of courses at the core of our adult product offerings, we are looking to take a further â€“ step further and offer a comprehensive and all encompassing product portfolio. We believe that English learning could not be limited to simply improving General English capabilities, but rather needs specific learning objectives under various scenarios in our daily lives. For example, for users who want to improve their English communication skills for business environment, they can achieve their goals through our Business English courses., Now let's turn to our Kids business. As we continue â€“ as we mentioned in â€“ on last quarter's earnings call, we have been actively developing relevant kids courses this year. Therefore, it's not surprising that in the third quarter, we saw significant increase in contribution from our Kids business to our overall revenue growth. We are differentiated from other kid products in the market as we have created an immersive learning experience for kids in different age groups by implementing our proprietary AI technologies., Our current course plan for Kids main courses covers Level I to Level VII, targeting users from kindergarten to sixth grade in primary school. In addition to the main course plan, we have added higher-priced SKUs to serve the needs of users with different learning objectives and purchasing power. Moreover, we have enriched our product mix by introducing more short duration courses such as in science and art and to attract users with diverse learning needs., We intend to utilize these shorter duration courses to convert users to higher-priced products and to improve overall conversion efficiency. So far we have completed the course content development for the first five levels and we will launch Levels VI and VII courses in 2021., In terms of long-term revenue enhancement at the company level, we have adopted a more focused marketing strategy for different users and to further increase cross-selling opportunities between our Adult and Kids business. Moreover, based on our sales capability, we established a traffic distribution mechanism and distributed more traffic to the teams with stronger sales capabilities., When it comes to streamlining our operations, in the third quarter, we continued to put forth strong efforts around enhancing operating efficiency, making solid progress both on our organizational restructuring and cost control initiatives that ultimately improving the bottom line., With respect to marketing activities, we plan to reduce our advertising costs through diversifying our user acquisition channels. Enhancing our capability and converting existing users is our top priority, as we intend to reduce dependency on acquisition of new users through third-party channels. Finally, technology advancements stand at the core of our growth strategy, allowing us to remain at the forefront of ensuring technology., Our products are highly differentiated and more dynamic than what exists in the market and what we used to offer, which were designed to satisfy usersâ€™ basic English learning needs, primarily helping users improve their pronunciation and learn new vocabulary. With our new AI teacher, Alix, which is a great leap forth - forward in AI-powered lecturing technology, users can speak and talk with Alix at anytime, anywhere at an affordable price., Selecting from a wide range of conversation topics, for example, we can hand out our grocery shopping, users can have a very interactive market conversation with Alix just as they would with a human teacher. Then they will receive differentiated and personalized responses from the conversation from Alix. Alix will then lead to continue this conversation with user as if a real person teacher would, at the same time, providing explanations, pronunciation, grammar corrections and recommendations., What makes Alix so highly useful and impactful is that users are more adept to really apply themselves into the learning things they do not need to worry about making mistakes in front of a real person. What's more interesting is, Alix would actually pause and wait for the student to come up with their own language and give encouraging responses and encouragements, just like a real person teacher would. And then Alix, it is a crucial point that when it comes to English learning, especially among students, this kind of capability is really important and useful., And the reason LAIX can develop this type of new technology is because we have one of the largest databases of English spoken by Chinese, which has been customized for deep learning processing, along with a proprietary algorithms and profound understanding of English teaching concepts and theory., This year marks LAIX' eight anniversary as a pioneer and leader in the AI-powered learning space and with a mission of empowering everyone to achieve their full potential. We continue to dive deeper into AI technology and English language education, dedicating ourselves to advancing proprietary AI technologies, aiming to provide the best online English learning product and making learning more personalized and effective., Since our inception, we have been constantly exploring user needs and improving the user learning experience from a technology-based, content-oriented user experience centered company culture and system. Looking ahead, we will continue executing on our growth initiatives, bringing our strong value proposition to market and maximizing long-term value to all of our shareholders., This concludes my prepared remarks. I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Mr. Bing Sun, who will discuss our key financial results."
23477,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4391728-laix-inc-s-laix-ceo-yi-wang-on-q3-2020-results-earnings-call-transcript,Bing Sun,"Thank you, Yi, and hello, everybody. This is Sun Bing. Let us now look at our key financial metrics in the third quarter of 2020. Net revenue were RMB239.4 million, a 11.1% decrease from RMB269.4 million for the previous quarter and an 8.26% decrease from RMB262.1 million for the same quarter last year. The quarter-over-quarter decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in gross billings caused by the company's stringent cost control in user acquisition expenditures., Cost of revenue was RMB65 million, a 14.1% decrease from RMB75.6 million for the previous quarter and a 9.6% decrease from RMB71.8 million for the same quarter last year. The quarter-over-quarter change was primarily attributable to due to efficiency optimization in personnel management and cost control in IT related services., Gross profit was RMB174.5 million, a 10% decrease from RMB193.8 million for the previous quarter and an 8.3% decrease from RMB190.3 million for the same quarter last year. Gross margin for the third quarter of 2020 was 72.9%, compared with 71.9% for the previous quarter and 72.6% for the same quarter last year., Total operating expenses were RMB252.1 million, a 13% decrease from RMB289.7 million for the previous quarter and a 37.7% decrease from RMB404.8 million for the same quarter last year. This change was primarily due to stringent cost control in user acquisition expenditures and optimization of our organizational structure., Sales and marketing expenses were RMB185.5 million, a 7.6% decrease from RMB200.7 million for the previous quarter and a 35.9% decrease from RMB289.2 million for the same quarter last year. The changes were primarily due to the company's stringent cost control in user acquisition expenditures., R&D expenses were RMB45.8 million, a 5.5% decrease from RMB48.5 million for the previous quarter and a 20.6% decrease from RMB57.7 million for the same quarter last year. The changes were primarily due to efficiency optimization in personnel management., SG&A expenses were RMB20.8 million, a 48.7% decrease from RMB40.5 million for the previous quarter, primarily due to a one-off impairment loss on leasehold improvement in the previous quarter. G&A expenses decreased by 64.1% from RMB57.9 million for the same quarter last year, primarily due to the efficiency optimization in personnel management., Loss from operations were RMB77.6 million, compared with RMB95.9 million for the previous quarter and RMB214.5 million for the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA was a loss of RMB55.6 million, compared with adjusted EBITDA loss of RMB77.8 million for the previous quarter and RMB203.6 million for the same quarter last year., Net loss was RMB70.6 million, compared with RMB92.5 million for the previous quarter and RMB214.1 million for the same quarter last year. Adjusted net loss was RMB61.4 million compared with RMB85.3 million for the previous quarter and RMB209.7 million for the same quarter last year., Basic and diluted net loss per ordinary share attributable to ordinary shareholders was RMB1.43 compared with RMB1.87 for the previous quarter and RMB4.33 for the same quarter last year., In terms of our balance sheet, as of September 30, 2020, the company's cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments totaled RMB327.2 million, compared with RMB390.3 million as of June 30, 2020 and RMB552.6 million as of December 31, 2019. Net cash used in operating activities were RMB53.1 million and RMB119.5 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively., Our liquidity to meet our future working capital is based on our ability to attract new users, enhance user engagement and retention by offering higher-quality and diversified courses while closely controlling the content costs and optimizing traffic acquisition strategy to effectively control and reduce these user-related costs., We will continue to further preserve liquidity and manage cash flow by reducing discretionary expenditures, including promotion expenses and SG&A expenses. Our liquidity is also based on our ability to obtain capital financing from equity or debt investors. We believe that we have sufficient cash to fund operations for at least the next 12 months., The company had deferred revenue of RMB823.4 million as of September 30, 2020 compared with RMB828.8 million as of June 30, 2020 and RMB696 million as of December 31, 2019., Now let's turn to look at our future outlook. For the fourth quarter of 2020, the company currently expects net revenue to be between RMB210 million to RMB230 million, which would represent a decrease of approximately 9.2% to 0.6% from RMB231.4 million for the same quarter last year. This forecast reflects the company's current and preliminary view on the current business situation and market conditions, which is subject to change., This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call to questions. As a reminder, Mr. Hu Zheren Ben, our CTO and Co-Founder; and Dr. Lin Hui, our Chief Scientist and Co-Founder, are joining us for the Q&A session.
