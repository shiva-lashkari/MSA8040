I'm Terri MacInnis, VP of Investor Relations., Joining us today are ImageWare's Chair Person and CEO, Kristin Taylor; and the Company's CFO, Jonathan Morris. Following those remarks, management will address your questions., Any statements made in today's discussion that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements as defined in the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Words such as anticipate, believe, estimate, expect, forecast, intend, may, plan, project, predict, if, should and will and similar expressions as they relate to ImageWare are intended to identify such forward-looking statements., ImageWare may, from time-to-time, update these publicly announced projections, but it is not obligated to do so. Any projections of future results of operations should not be construed in any manner as a guarantee that such results will, in fact, occur. These projections are subject to change and could differ materially from final reported results., For a discussion of such risks and uncertainties, please see risk factors in ImageWare's annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, and other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made., I remind everyone that a replay of the webcast will be available for 90 days on the Company's website at www.iwsinc.com. Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any way without the expressed written consent of ImageWare is strictly prohibited., Now, I'll turn the call over to Jonathan Morris, Chief Financial Officer. Jonathan?, Jonathan Morris, Thank you, Terri, and welcome to those of you joining our call today. Our financial results are available on our website and the recently published news release and form 10-Q. For context on today's discussion, I'll provide a brief summary of those results., Revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2020, grew 215% to $2.471 million, up from $785,000 for 2019. The revenue for both years primarily reflected our legacy business. This increase was primarily driven by services revenue for smart badge technology, including software integration services, system installation services and customer training for one large customer, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs for a combined value of $1.2 million., These larger than average fluctuations are typically due to project-oriented solutions for our federal customer segment. Based on our current visibility with market conditions, we believe that we will see an increase in federal government procurement and implementations with respect to Identity management initiatives., Gross profits for the three months ended September 30, 2020 grew 152% to $1.633 million, as compared with $647,000 in a comparable period of 2019. Gross margin decreased to 66% in 2020 compared with 82% in 2019 due to the one-time impact of additional services costs incurred for this one particular customer. Although changes in our costs are typically caused by revenue fluctuations, cost of services can also vary depending on the level and complexity of services required., We are encouraged that new bookings for the quarter increased 28% to $2,014,933 as compared with $1,573,140 in the same period last year. The 70 bookings include 46 new up sells plus 24 renewals. Our sales team is delivering growth through strong renewals and critical momentum with new business., A comment regarding bookings, historically our software licenses typically provided customers with the right to use our software in perpetuity, as it exists when made available to the customer. We're now moving customers to a subscription model with contracts that are typically 12 months in length and for which revenue will be recognized ratably over the course of the year. New bookings therefore represent new contracts signed in the period that will be recognized as revenue over the life of the contract., We believe this will significantly increase the lifetime value of our customers as well as enhance our profitability as we consistently maintain an approximate 95% renewal rate. We have also started a process with our existing customers where possible of transitioning them from the current annualized maintenance agreements in place to multi-year subscription agreements., Loss from operations for the three months ended September 30, 2020 was $1,070,000 compared with the loss of $3,044,000 for the same quarter in 2019. This improvement of approximately $1.9 million from the third quarter of 2019 is due primarily to increased revenue of approximately $1.7 million and the decrease in operating expenses of approximately $988,000 related to our continued efforts to reduce expenses. We ended the third quarter with 2,906,000i n cash., Before I begin our discussion of nine month results I'd like to talk about how our pipeline generation continues to be a major focus for both the sales and marketing teams. Monthly webinars are a valuable tool being used successfully to showcase products and new developments to both new and existing customers. In Q3, marketing launched a new security focus newsletter as yet another way to communicate our value proposition to our audiences. Marketing has driven a 50% increase in organic website traffic. Our updated website will support each of these efforts when it is launched early next year., In the third quarter, our growing sales pipeline added 79 net new near term opportunities. We have 56 new opportunities in our state and local law enforcement customer segment. And for our enterprise customers, we have 23 new opportunities including 15 for our GoVerifyID product, six for our enroll-proof solution platform, and two new significant opportunities for professional services. This compares with Q2 2020 in which we added more than 67 net new opportunities., It is important to note however that although we continue to see strong demand, the time it takes to close deals, particularly for new customers of lengthening as a result of COVID-19. At the time of our quarterly call, we are experiencing a slower return to normal condition than we had anticipated although we viewed this as a relatively short-term disruption that does not impact our long-term strategy and initiatives., Turning now to nine months results, revenue for nine months ended September 30, 2020, totaled $3,999,000, up from $2,527,000 for 2019. The revenue for both years primarily reflected our legacy business. Gross profits for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, totaled $2,890,000 as compared with $2,046,000 in the comparable period of 2019., Gross margin decreased to 72% in 2020 compared with 81% in 2019 and is primarily attributable to the one-time costs associated with the customer previously mentioned. Loss from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 was 6,781,000 compared with $9,235,000 for the same period in 2019., Turning now to our capital raising efforts undertaken to support our plans for substantial growth. During Q3, the Company sold 3.2 million shares of common stock to Lincoln Park Capital under the terms of a purchase agreement resulting in cash proceeds of $669,000. In addition, we closed a $2.2 million equity advance in the quarter as the first tranche of the Series D preferred capital raise. On November 12, we closed a total of $11.56 million in the Series D round, the proceeds from which will be used for general corporate and working capital purposes., Along with the closing, we announced several restructuring initiatives including a simplification of the Company's capital structure, which will remove the preferred Series A and Series C as well as a full restructuring of the Board of the Directors leaving Kristin Taylor, President and CEO on the board and appointing [Jim Demetrius] and [Vince Mill]. Kris was also appointed Chair of the Board., Another part of the organizational restructuring designed to increase shareholder value is the Company's plans to file in December a listing application for its common stock to trade on the NASDAQ exchange. The new board views the uplifting of ImageWare stock as a part of building value. These material improvements in both our balance sheet and our financial outlook provide the Company with the runway needed to execute on its business plan., I'm pleased to say that we've made important progress in Q3, while we continue to focus on cost controls, as well as other efficiencies, we will take steps as required to ensure the business is operating on a reasonable cost basis and maximum efficiency on a way to becoming cash flow positive, building revenue remains our first priority. This concludes my financial summary., I'll now turn the call over to Kris for the progress update on our business strategy. Kris?, Kristin Taylor, Thank you, Jonathan, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. We are feeling the impacts of COVID-19. The virus is surging. In California alone, we are seeing nearly 11,000 new cases daily and more than 12 million U.S citizens have confirmed infections. Tens of thousands of new cases are reported daily. As much as we thought we would have been through the worst of it, the reality is the pandemic is affecting our current clients and partners as well as our potential clients., Prior to the pandemic, ImageWare operated with a 20% remote workforce model with today's 100% distributed virtual team performing at such a high level. We are in negotiations to sublease our current 8,000 square foot office space in San Diego. As a next step, we will seek a more innovative new space that would allow us to create a demonstration environment for potential clients in our three verticals, law enforcement public safety, federal, as well as the enterprise. We will look for a bright and open office space that is inviting for collaboration., The new space would accommodate what we expect to be a majority of our workforce continuing to work remotely even after the world returns to a new normal. Our new office will be designed to encompass our vision to support our mostly work-from-home team with a place to hold some board and office meetings, demos and testing. As a biometrics first cybersecurity company, we are building on our legacy of providing the very highest level of security to systems, data, places, and facilities by identifying and authenticating people through biometrics., Our putting biometrics first is a competitive delineation. Since I joined ImageWare in March, we spent much of the last three quarterly calls reviewing our history and the many unique benefits of our technology. Today, I'll discuss progress made since the prior quarter where we are and where we are headed. At the end of the day, it's all about our relentless focus on driving results. Today's call is fundamentally different because having just closed an $11.56 million financing, we now have the much needed working capital to fuel the Company. I'll also review what we have been able to accomplish over the past 8 months in an austere environment, and what we are able to do now that we are funded., Of course, as Jonathan pointed out, we'll continue to look for cost savings, while we spend strategically to accelerate sales. We continue to execute on our strategy to optimize legacy products, as we refresh and integrate them with the latest cloud and mobile technologies, to define our niche in the security market place, to deliver increased value to the customer in numerous sectors and realize cash flow positive by growing consistent revenue., Our engineering sales and marketing teams are firing on all cylinders, communicating and working closely together. They're executing against our new engineering product and organizational roadmaps, while seeking to improve operations and efficiencies. They are working tirelessly each day to refine, enhance and develop our suite of products for those previously mentioned verticals., I'll discuss the Identity Platform in more detail. Components of the platform include the IWS Biometric Engine known as BE, law enforcement and at the smart badges as well as GoVerifyID known as GVID. As I've discussed several calls ago, we're creating an Identity Platform that provides customers with an end-to-end platform to enroll, identify, authenticate and manage users that will appeal to customers from all three of our vertical segments., For example, a law enforcement officer will enroll a perpetrator much in the same way as a national identity client or a university enrolling its students or a hospital enrolling patients. Our revitalization of the BE, which is the soul of our products, continues and should be completed by Q1 of 2021. In the meantime, the work we have completed on this patented open platform database already makes it sleeker and faster., We spoke last quarter about the need to finish GVID our MFA offering. I'm pleased to report that the six month multi-phase upgrade will be completed in a few short days by November 30. This allows the sales team to double down on targeted outreach, including to existing partners who need multi-factor authentication., Features now include new protocol support and web applications, new UI or user interface, new security and monitoring layers, comprehensive testing, updated look and ease of use for Android and iOS clients. Cloud-based architecture to automate development test cycles and reduce cloud costs, a new SaaS model, new documentation provisioning and ease of use for clients, new landing page, data sheets, marketing and sales materials, and portals to ease demonstration and use of the product., A self-service portal would be released in early 2021. We can now focus on key markets who desperately need authentication such as financial, healthcare, manufacturing education, call centers, and the growing number of remote workers. We will do this while building more depth and value into the product and increasing the ease of usability. We are focused on GVID workforce and GVID customer for biometric login access, as well as leveraging the GVID platform with a new unique implementation for the remote worker. We will be discussing this new implementation in more detail in the coming months., We announced a partnership with Laxton in December of 2019. As a bridge to the new Law Enforcement 2.0 platform, I'm happy to announce that in October, we completed a new QuickCapture mobile software product that resides on the Laxton Chameleon 5 and 8 devices. This is a powerful solution that allows officers, public safety and military personnel in the field to have dynamic data on a perpetrator in the palm of their hands., This software will be an inherent part of the final law enforcement 2.0. But in the meantime, this gives us a powerful product to demo and sell to law enforcement and public safety sectors. The feature already has resonated very well in the past 30 days and allowed for us to compete in more bids of work. We have shown a demo of this product to more than 15 agencies across the globe with an overwhelming interest., Our modernization of the new law enforcement platform includes adding a cloud back-end and more functionality that the public safety users have asked for. We've been providing an innovative digital platform to law enforcement to identify perpetrators faster and more accurately since the mid 1990s. In law enforcement and public safety, we are not only growing existing customers, but we are selling to new police departments across the world., As a reminder, there are 18,000 police departments across North America and we presently sell to a single-digit percentage of them. The market is ripe for us to grow. Over the past quarter, we pitched to over 300 new police and public safety agencies. We pitched to more than 50 existing agencies. We are actively pursuing state and provincial certifications. We are expanding into EMS, emergency medical services such as fire ambulance and senior services, Medicare and other state agencies., We conducted several webinars tailored to law enforcement and attended virtual conferences to locate new prospects to garner and refine our strategy. We have grown the sales funnel by more than 150% in 2020 in this area of our business, and we have retained several key research analyst firms to obtain important data with which to build our suppositions about the law enforcement and public safety market and to place key bets in these strategic areas., Without good data we are operating in a vacuum. Our commitment to the law enforcement market is evidenced by recent addition to our sales team of a member with deep experience in the public safety arena. We're expanding our focus across all 50 states, the Canadian provinces as well as overseas., Moving on to EPI, which is what we call our physical and logical access with biometric smart badging. Work is ongoing to modernize our EPI smart badge 2.0 platform. This area has been a key part of the work we do with Fortune 1000 in providing these clients with physical and logical access., Badging is a key tenant of the Identity Platform and will be leveraged in many implementations such as national identity programs including drivers license projects within the U.S. and Latin America, federal government work including the office of Veterans Affairs, and employee security with EPS cubic transportation on behalf of the New York, MTA, and Saudi Aramco., Jonathan already noted how the sales team is closing deals and building a vital new pipeline of business. More often, we are up selling additional ImageWare products to our existing customer base. This is critical for us to keep revenue coming. Existing loyal customers understand the value of our software and the 24x7 support we have given to them through the years., Our pipeline continues to grow as a result of our strategizing to uncover key customers, new verticals and regions. We have increased marketing campaigns, webinars, analyst and financial engagements, and newsletters. We are accelerating our digital and performance marketing strategies by hiring a talented agency., We are in the process of rebuilding our company narrative which directly ties in to creating a new website already underway. I'd like to point out the obvious. One of the foundational keys to our progress and evolution to ImageWare 2.0 wouldn't be possible without the vital contributions and hard work of Sudheer Koganti, VP of Engineering and his quality first engineering team., I've heard Sudheer say this so many times, if you have quality then you can be fast. Engineering has been busy optimizing as they develop. Some of the key achievements of our creative engineering team include automation of the release process with increased product velocity, which means more features driving more revenue, optimization through open source replacing code for open source reduces cost and increases velocity, significantly reduce cloud costs, lowered resource use and increased automation resulting in what is thus far a 60% cost reduction, also monthly software releases and accompany roadmap and POR meetings that are highly collaborative between engineering, product management and sales., The first new released by the new development team is BioIntellic. This is a feature we announced in July of 2019 and was embedded into the BE. BioIntellic is a critical piece in proofing, and proofing is a critical piece in biometrics. Biometrics within proofing glues the user to a government issued ID, secure on-boarding of users with legal credentials in addition to validating a user with BioIntellic's anti-spoofing and liveliness allows for a complete secure enrollment process., Given the vital role that anti-spoofing and matching play improving, we felt that it was imperative to create standalone functionality for BioIntellic for more competitive pricing and efficiencies. BioIntellic is a distinguishing feature in our work in matching and identification. The new BioIntellic integrates with the refreshed biometric engine providing higher performance at a lower cost., This upgrade is important because it bolsters our joint offering with our relationship with proofing partner contactable in the African market. It also supports our existing MTN business and further it is helping us to aggressively compete for new business with African telecom companies., Our initial Q2 deployment of GVID multi-factor authentication solution to a medium-sized bank in Latin America with our partner in the region, Fujitsu is performing well and has expanded in scope. We anticipate more deals with Fujitsu, not only in Latin America, but in other parts of the world, including some large opportunities already underway in Continental Europe., Biometrics have been in existence for a long time. The military was one of the early adopters to use the human body for identification and authentication. Many players may surround us, but no one has made biometrics first in the authentication process like ImageWare has. The world is now a different place from where it was 10 months ago as the requirements for identifying oneself have evolved to touchless and contactless., Biometric authentication is finally set to explode, particularly in this pandemic world we live in now. Our philosophy of using multiple biometrics, such as face, voice, finger, palm, et cetera provides the highest level of security, greater accuracy, and speed and matching along with enhanced convenience for the user. The fact that we are an open platform, essentially agnostic to deployments for use with vendors distinguishes ImageWare., We want to enable instant binding of our multimodal and fusion capabilities to allow for a frictionless authentication and re-authentication to critical systems, data, or cloud services for banking and other related regulated industries. We believe this idea of continuous biometric authentication or re-authentication is going to become an important part of the user experience., Our work in Zero Trust is increasing. This is a security concept that centers on the notion that organizations should not trust anything in or outside its perimeters. And instead must verify anything and everything trying to connect to its systems. We believe there are several use cases where we see GVID working in Zero Trust implementations. We are working with partners and vendors to increase the use of Zero Trust in our platform., We thank those of you who believed in ImageWare and the team including institutional investors, non to wholly capital management, along with existing and new shareholders who invested in our recently completed $11.56 million offering. This capital infusion unlocks many important doors and opportunities for us. We now have the financial foundation from which to support revenue, fulfill our strategic vision and achieve our goals., We remained focused on the current business plan to restart sales on GVID and expand LE through new product sales and product investments, all while upgrading in a manner that integrates the individual products into the broader Identity Platform and manages the biometric life cycle at scale. We look forward to being recognized in the marketplace and taking our rightful place in the cybersecurity sector. We are focused on three things, sales, sales, and more sales., Looking ahead, we see great promise for our sales in the enterprise in 2021 and beyond. The growing imperative to work remotely and secure remote workers and their data has cemented a paradigm shift, one that is likely to extend far beyond the end of the pandemic, as previously noted. In response, we've been expanding GVID to manage this new paradigm., We have an unparalleled ability to biometrically secure remote workers data and we will look forward to delivering a new product. We have identified numerous expansion opportunities around Zero Trust, about which we'll update you on in 2021. We plan to add additional sales and engineering new hires over the next 60 days in order to expand our overall revenue growth in North America and beyond., We spoke last quarter about our patent and intellectual property strategy to monetize what is one of the most cited, multimodal biometric patent portfolios in the world. Since partnering with ipCapital Group, our licensing plan efforts began in earnest last month. Additionally, the pace to generate more meaningful patents on a monthly basis is also in process with the help of our IP counsel, [Nick Cole], and our engineering organization. We are actively pursuing licenses and hope to see the first revenues from these efforts in 2021., Remember, our IP portfolio only grows more valuable as the use of biometric multifactor authentication expands in the marketplace. We look forward to keeping you updated on our progress. We are building momentum. As I said on our last call, my vision for our company success to use a baseball analogy will be a result of our consistently hitting singles and doubles with an occasional home run., We needed to make a number of completions, enhancements and improvements in various products in order to begin making meaningful sales. A good part of that process is now behind us, and along with ongoing work, we are now beginning to make those sales. We continue to expect that revenue flow will be lumpy. It's the nature of our business in general and not unexpected during this rebuilding phase., While COVID-19 is driving heightened interest in cyber security for remote workers and our multi-factor authentication GVID solution, we are also beginning to see the flip side of that coin. The surge in global pandemic continues to slow some projects and present occasional challenges to closing business. Some meetings are more difficult to set, the unpredictable availability of technical staff, offices reopening and closing can slow down decision-making by customers., As I mentioned last quarter, it's hampered our ability to progress more quickly to develop an agreement we have with a particular foreign government. We have set a course and are now firmly on our way to execute, and achieve our business plan goals. We have the right technology, the right team, and now for the first time are well funded with a clear runway before us., Now it all comes down to focus and execution. I've never been more excited about the opportunities before us or more confident and our ability to achieve them. This concludes our prepared remarks. We appreciate the questions you recently submitted via e-mail. And now, we'll begin our question-and-answer session., Question-and-Answer Session, A - Kristin Taylor, We've been asked, will the business ImageWare does with IBM be affected by the split up of their operations IBM recently announced that it would cut away the managed infrastructure services cloud business from its larger services business and create a new company yet to be named., [NewCo] will help service more customers to manage infrastructure across the hyperscale platforms. Customers will pay [NewCo] to manage any application on any cloud platform. On a positive note, [NewCo] will give us the opportunity to partner with companies across all cloud vendors for biometric authentication, not just IBM. In 2014, we forged a relationship with IBM Security and IBM Global Services that is unaffected by this split. We continue to team with IBM and look for partnership across global opportunities., In fact, we are in the process of becoming an IBM partner which brings us closer to IBM to team with them. But first, we must go through a certification process. A shareholder noted that I have built a reputation for getting close to those who influence corporate decision makers and asked, has this been happening at ImageWare and with what success?, My life is about relationships, and not just corporate decision makers. As many of you have known, I believe that life is about connection and loyalty. Results are important, but relationships are what matter. Although, I have been busy fundraising, I have not stopped my efforts to speak to my large global personal network about ImageWare., I have been reaching out to corporate friends, friends of friends, technical and financial analysts. I'm finding great interest from some of these connections. It is imperative for us to finish our GVID MFA product, refresh the biometric engine as well as get moving on the EPI smart badging platform upgrade. All of these products appeal to the enterprise clients., And in turn, I want to be able to offer finish products that are capable of immediate use. In terms of the law enforcement space, an area I do not have an old network in, I had been developing new relationships with important advisors, who have helped to make critical introductions to heads of state, ambassadors, police chiefs and military personnel. This has been paying off as I have weekly calls with law enforcement and public safety high level officials that have been leading to meaningful business., Kristin Taylor, This concludes our Q&A session. At this time, I'd like to end our call with a brief closing comment. Thank you again for joining us today. I'll leave you with the thought that the entire team and I do our utmost each and every day to build momentum, drive strong growth prospects to deliver best in class growth, expand sales, and take the steps needed to help make ImageWare, the successful company we all know it can be., We are making progress against our strategic priorities and executing on our broad vision to expand the growth of our company. I encourage anyone with questions or feedback to reach out to our Investor Relations team or myself., Stay safe and be well. We wish you a happy holiday season. Thank you again., Operator",[]

This is John Hamilton, Chief Executive of Panoro Energy ASA and welcome to our third quarter year-to-date 2020 results presentation. I'm joined today by Richard Morton, our Technical Director; and Nigel McKim, our Projects Director; and Qazi Qadeer, our CFO. We'll take you through this presentation; we'll open it up for some Q&A towards the end., I understand that the link to news web this morning had a glitch in its -- when it was generated by news web, so I'm very glad that so many people have been able to find their way on to presentation. We're busy trying to fix that as well at the moment, but we do have a number of attendees here this morning. So that's good., Next slide please. So, as a reminder, today's conference call contains certain statements that are may be deemed to be forward-looking statements, which include all statements other than statements of historical fact. Forward-looking statements involve making certain assumptions, based on the company's experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors that we believe are appropriate under the circumstances., Although, we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable, actual events or results may differ materially from those projected or implied in such forward-looking statements, due to known or unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors., Next slide, please. So, for those of you who have joined us before, the system is webinar system, you have the ability to raise your hand to ask a question. As long as I can see the hand, we can unmute you and allow you to ask a question, you can also type in a question down into the question pane and we'll try and pick those up as well. Depending on how many there are, we try and address those as well towards the end., Next slide, please. So what are the key takeaways here? We've all had a year to forget in some ways. It's been a very challenging year for the oil sector for everybody. But there's also a year to remember. Remember, that actually we have a good company. We have a lot of interesting things happening in it and we've managed to come through the crisis, I think, although, we're still arguably still in parts of it in good shape., We have production growth. We have production growth in our core assets in Tunisia and Gabon, recently demonstrated by us hitting in our 5,000 barrel a day gross target in Tunisia, where there's also additional potential. In Gabon, you're going to see production growth each year from 2021 through 2024. So we have it all in front of us in terms of that production growth., We also have quite a bit of exploration upside in the company as well. We’ll talk a little bit more about Hibiscus. Those of you who followed Hibiscus know that it could be 3 times as big as the currently booked reserves. We have the ambition, as a joint venture in Gabon, to drill two wells per year, every five -- for a total of five years of 10 wells at least. We hope to kick that off already in 2021. We'll talk a little bit more about that. And in Tunisia and South Africa, we also have further upside potential., In our company, we have a well-governed company. We have a good board. We are financially conservative. We have a deliberate strategy to grow a stable and sustainable business that’s focus on HSE, on ESG. And we also have the dividending of the PetroNor share to Rhemoura shareholders when that deal completes, hopefully in the near future. So, again, we've come through a difficult year, but -- well, we think we're well poised to grow from here., Next slide, please. A few operational highlights and financial highlights that are all embedded within our Q3 results and you can read those in greater detail. However, I will touch on a few of these. We did hit 5,000 barrels a day gross production and we've maintained that production level Q4 to date. So as we speak, we're producing and have produced since October 1, approximately 5,000 barrels a day., We drilled the first new well in Tunisia successfully, without any HSE incident, which is very, very proud of that. And we established two production zones, including the Douleb. We have two production zones in that particular well. I'll talk a little bit more about the Douleb in couple of slides further. And we have more workovers that we're currently working on over the next three, four months, we should be trying to bring a few new wells on stream as well, not new wells, not new drills, but workover wells., Hibiscus, we will talk more about that, but that could be 3 times as big as previously identified in Gabon. And Gabon is also quite exciting in the sense that the crisis has allowed us to relook at the development concept for the next phases of Gabon and identified material cost savings., On the gross revenue side, you can see the numbers there. What's interesting to note is, we've had five liftings year-to-date, but we have three more in Q4. So something like 35% to 40% of our revenue will be booked in the fourth quarter. So, it's quite a heavy quarter coming up., OpEx per barrel still very, very attractive, low operating cost barrels that we have. These are not ones that require high oil prices. We enjoy high oil prices, but we don't require them. Our hedging, our conservative financial strategy has continued to pay us dividends so to speak and we're busy in advanced negotiations for a reserve-based loan, an RBL, a structured loan to help finance the next phases of our development in Gabon., Next slide please. So, this is a slide we've shown recently and this is just updated we have made $3.9 million in cash realized gains off of our hedging program so far year-to-date. We have collars that have a floor of $55 on them. So, if oil is $45 on those barrels that we've hedged, we make $10. And we have this hedging program all the way through to the end of 2021, representing approximately of 30% of our current production something like that., So, on average for the barrels we've hedged, we probably made about $20 a barrel and across our entire production that represents something like $7 of extra revenue that we're -- $7 per barrel extra revenue we're making off the back of this hedging program which has really put us in good shape during 2020., Next slide please. So Gabon update. Some of this has already been rehearsed by BW Energy in their third quarter results, but we had gross production in the quarter of 15,500 barrels a day during the quarter. We have four wells in production there at the moment. The gross total production for 2020 is estimated at around 14,250 barrels of oil per day slightly down on previous operator guidance. That's largely due to some COVID-related things of the shutdown of the FPSO briefly. And also a little bit of the OpEx situations trying not to max things out too badly., The four wells are doing extremely well. This is not a reflection of the reservoir. This is simply operational. The four wells are -- each of them performing extremely well at the moment., OpEx per barrel is approximately $19 a barrel for 2020, slightly higher than had been originally guided by the operator and that is largely down to COVID costs which we hope will fall away during the course of next year., Next slide please. So, there's a lot of information on this slide, but actually the message is quite simple. We have 112 million barrels discovered in Gabon and Dussafu. We have to find more obviously but bet is we have our current 2P booked reserves at and we are busy in a middle phased development approach. So, we have Tortue Phase 1 which we did. We have Tortue Phase 2, which we're most of the way through we have to bring two more wells on stream during next year. So, we've gone from 10,000 to roughly 20,000 barrels a day through that phase., The next phase coming up we should see first oil probably in the fourth quarter of 2022 is Hibiscus/Ruche Phase I which should see us come up to the nameplate capacity of the FPSO about 40,000 barrels a day could be a little bit higher than that. We have also Hibiscus/Ruche Phase 2., Now, in an upside case where we're able to identify additional reserves at a Hibiscus, we could see pushing the FPSO capacity beyond its current nameplate capacity. This FPSO does have the capacity to go to 60,000 or maybe 70,000 barrels a day of processing capacity. So, we have the flexibility to upsize the FPSO capacity in a success case and we are on this journey now to get to at least 40,000 barrels a day., And on the right-hand side of the slide, you can see what the operating cost evolution here is, the operating cost at Dussafu is largely a fixed cost. More barrels we produce, the lower the operating cost per barrel is as we get to 2023, 2022, we bring the new wells on stream at Hibiscus, you will see our operating costs dropping down to something like $11 or $12 a barrel., And what does that mean? That means even when Brent's are something like $45 a barrel we were making more than $20 operational free cash flow per barrel. It's after tax after operating expense. So, this is an extremely profitable operation even at today's oil prices. Obviously, if oil prices go up to $50 or $60 or dare I say it's $70, this is an enormous cash cap., Next slide please. So, there's been a lot of talk about Hibiscus. I've got a couple of new images here, but just taking a step back reminding people what happened. We had this as a prospect, it was 11 million barrels we thought we were drilling for. We ended up having big success on that., As everybody can recall, we booked about 45 million barrels of 2P reserves off the back of the wellbore and the sidetrack. Since then the joint venture is engaged in reprocessing the seismic that Panoro acquired back in 2013 and 2014. And what that has done is, if you can look at the two images, the first image is the map you can see the high areas there the red -- the brighter amplitude in the front there the red is what we thought the structure looked like. When we drilled it and found the 45 million barrels., The structure on the right is what -- based on the seismic reprocessing and the new mapping we've done is what it could be. And this is where the excitement has come again I don't -- you don't have to be able to read technical maps to see that the red areas, the yellow areas, this is a much bigger structure potentially., We'll have to drill a couple of wells to delineate this which we plan to get after already in 2021 by drilling an additional well. But the -- I think the picture tells the story that this structure could be enormous. It could be up to 155 million barrels potentially. And we hope to be able to drill the first of those wells this summer when we have the rig back out there drilling the production wells., Next slide please. So that's not all. The Hibiscus isn't in the end of the story. We have 13 more prospects and leads. We have the ambition as a joint venture to drill two exploration wells per year for the next five years. What will those be? We'll need to see. I think the first well we’re going to drill are going to be in the Hibiscus area. But after that, we could be looking at Prospect B. We could be looking at Hibiscus North, Espadon, String of Pearls, Prospect 18. There are lots of things to go for here., And with the recently reprocessed seismic, the teams are very, very busy. So BW is operator, but Panoro on its own as well. Tullow their own as well and GOC, our state-owned gold company on their own are all looking at this reprocess seismic each coming up with our own interpretations and we'll be sharing those with each other in due course. It does take some time. But we're very, very excited for instance. And we concentrated on really looking at the Hibiscus areas first which is what's generated those maps., We are in a very, very good oil fairway and we have this block for 18 years. So we've got plenty of time to find this stuff. So Gabon Dussafu block will be a long-term asset for Panoro and its partners., Next slide please. So I'll talk a little bit about Tunisia. We hit the 5000 barrel day gross production target. We previously announced that. We have further work-overs underway as we speak. We drilled the first well for over six years on the block in the Guebiba field which is one of our onshore fields, where we found oil in two reservoirs; the Bireno, which is the more common and prolific reservoir in this area. And also in the Douleb, which is less common. But when you find it, it's very, very good. I'll touch on that in a moment., Gross production as previously guided was 3261 in the quarter, previously guided that this was going to be a weak quarter in terms of production due to needing to replace two pumps on two very important wells for us. So we kind of had two of our big wells need replacement at the same time, a bit unusual but it happens and we flagged that earlier., Our quarter four production to date is 5000 barrels a day. We're currently producing around that level. So hopefully it will be a strong quarter in Q4 for us and OpEx per barrel. Again these are very low operating cost assets. You may see a little creep up of operating cost per barrel in the fourth quarter because a lot of this workover activity is classified as operating cost, not as capital expenditure. But nonetheless the assets are cheap operating cost assets., Next slide please. And here's a graphic. We've shown it before but we've extrapolated it now out to incorporate the last three months. As you can see when we took over the asset, it was producing around on the left there around 3500, 3700 somewhere in that zone. We were able in the first part of this year to kind of get that up to 4000 barrels a day. COVID struck. We had to down tools, so to speak. We just continue to want to produce oil and not produce it with too much difficulty with cruise things like that, so production did fall off a little bit., And as previously guided we had a third quarter we needed to not only contend with COVID, but we had to replace a couple of pumps on two of our key wells. But then immediately into the fourth quarter, we managed to hit our 5,000 barrel a day target, which we have, as you can see maintained and even exceeded at times during the quarter. So I think this tells the story of the ability at Panoro to get after these assets. These were unloved by OMV. It's taken us some time but we have the right boots on the ground and we are now getting after these assets in a good way., Next slide, please. So what are the next challenges? We hit 5,000, we want to do better than 5,000. Historically, these fields have produced 6,000 to 8,000 barrels a day. There've been spikes where those have been higher than that. But consistently back when the assets were invested in and loved, they were able to produce 6,000 to 8,000 barrels a day. And I think that that is not a target we're setting out here today but that is a reasonable expectation of the ambition we have on the asset. That's the next step., Our workover production – our workover activity continues as we speak and we have further stimulation, optimization workover initiatives identified beyond the end of the first quarter 2021. And what for us is important is that this is again, like Dussafu is a long-term asset for Panoro. And what we want to do is make sure that it continues to produce oil for a long period of time. And so we've been spending a lot of time remapping and modeling fields to try and justify and try and convince our partners and ourselves that the assets can need continued investment in, And one of the interesting things that's happened is the Guebiba. When we drilled Guebiba-10, we encountered the Douleb reservoir, which is a very exciting reservoir in Guebiba field dominantly, although we do find it in other fields in the area as well., Now we knew it existed. We knew we would find it. What we've ended up finding is on logs. It looks like a very, very good quality Douleb reservoir. We do produce some Douleb at the moment in other wells. The Bireno, which is a lower reservoir is a more prolific producer of those wells produce 300, 400, 500 barrels a day type of thing, very good wells, very economic wells and they produce for a long period of time., The Douleb is a different animal. It can produce 1,000, 1,500 maybe 2,000 barrels a day of these wells. And so when you can find them in a good location and you can provide the right water support, water injection support for them. They can really produce exceptionally well., So as you can see, if we're able to identify additional locations to produce the Douleb from. We have a chance of really changing the production profile of some of these fields. We're currently in Guebiba-10, which is where we have the Douleb producing from the lower Bireno reservoir, that's producing oil as we speak. And we will produce that until such time as it becomes less interesting to produce than we've drained the reserves in which case will come up the well more we're recompleting the Douleb and we hope to achieve production rates at the time that I've indicated there., We also have other potential in the Cercina field, the Rhemoura field the El Ain field. So there's a lots more potential in these assets. And again, the key here is to make sure that we have a stable and growing production base for the longer-term here., We also have the Salloum West exploration well, which we have planned for 2021. In the success case, we can tie that back to TPS as well. So we have plenty to go for in Tunisia still to come., Next slide, please. Further corporate updates Block 2B in South Africa, this is the very exciting block that we farmed in together with Africa Energy. We're expecting approvals from the ministry to enter into this Block before Christmas we hope. Completion of our deal subject to that consent from minister is also subject to Azinam, we're the proposed operator coming in and farming into the Block as well. So fully funded well there., The pandemic again just like in Dussafu has created some opportunities to relook at things, to retender things and we're looking at some cost savings on that as well. In the meantime, the technical teams have been able to continue to advance their thoughts in terms of the best downhole locations and things like that., Aje. Aje continued to produce oil. We had a lifting even recently. We continue to work closely with PetroNor in respect of the disposal of this ministerial consents can take a long time in Nigeria and this has not been an exception. That process is well underway. The regulator is currently reviewing the proposed documentation. And we hope that that transaction will complete sometime soon. Fourth quarter maybe early into the first quarter. And the intention is once we receive the PetroNor shares that are consideration for that transaction that we will dividend those to Panoro shareholders., Next slide, please. ESG. One of the things we're very proud of is all this work-over work that we've done in Tunisia. We had two rigs going. We drilled the first well for six years in the block. We had multiple crews, we had COVID to contend with as well on top of all that and we performed all those operations without incident. , In Gabon, similarly, we were able -- the operator was able to maintain production operations through this very, very difficult period. So I think what we're finding is that our policies our procedures and we really withstood some serious tests over the past year. And we're very, very proud of that. We're even able to initiate our solar program, solar initiative in Tunisia where we've set up solar panel lighting for our operational, our own use on power use in some of our fields down in Tunisia. , So we are proud of our ESG footprint. We can always do better. We are setting up benchmarking, which to benchmark ourselves against the industry and against our own performance as we go forward. So the company is taking these things very seriously and continues to consider ourselves very, very well-governed company in this respect. , Next slide please. So on the final slide, I think we have a lot to look forward to production growth within the company to look forward to have exploration wells during 2021 to look forward to. And all of this set within a company that has a good balance sheet. It's got low-cost production and can withstand times of low oil price. , We have the dividending in the PetroNor shares to look forward to. And we always have to remind ourselves particularly when oil was at $20 a barrel, but the reserves, the resources that we have are extremely valuable even in down cycle times. We are in a cyclical industry. Hopefully we're about to hit an up cycle. And these reserves and resources we have will continue to be valuable in our opinion. , So that concludes my presentation. I think the next slide is a reminder on how to ask questions. And as long as we can master the technology, we will try and identify if anybody has any questions. So you can enter questions in the text box or you can raise your hand here. , Well see I've got a raised hand here sorry let me get my technology correct here. All right, I'm trying to unmute Stephen Foucaud. And for some reason he's – Stephen, I think you have to unmute yourself. , Question-and-Answer Session"

On the call today, we have Mikhail Zhukov, our Chief Executive Officer; Grigorii Moiseev, our Chief Financial Officer; and Dmitry Sergienkov, our Chief Strategy Officer. A press release containing our third quarter 2020 results was issued earlier today, and a copy may be obtained through our website at investor.hh.ru., Now I will briefly walk you through the Safe Harbor statements. These discussions will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from the results predicted or implied by such statements, and forward-looking statements made today speak only to our expectations as of today. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise these statements., For a discussion of some of the risk factors that could cause actual results to differ, please see the Risk Factors section in our Annual Report on the Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2019, and our final prospectus in connection with our public offering that was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on June 16, 2020., During this call, we will be referring to some non-IFRS financial measures. Reconciliation of the non-IFRS financial measures to the most directly comparable IFRS measures is provided in the earnings release we issued today and the slide presentation, each of which is available on our website at investor.hh.ru., Now I’ll turn the call over to Mikhail to make a quick opening remarks. Please go ahead., Mikhail Zhukov, Thank you, Roman. And good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to today’s call. We believe that our performance in the third quarter confirmed the statement that efficient remote solutions in such an important function as recruitment are vital for any enterprise. During this challenging year, we managed to grow our customer base serving almost 290,000 companies all over Russia and the CIS since the beginning of the year. Many of our clients have adapted to remote operations and now conduct hiring entirely online., Importantly, our timely recovery measures helped us to gain market momentum and accelerate growth, even despite the impact from the second wave of COVID-19. We are great to see all customer segments return to expansion and keep improving week after week. This gives us confidence that once we are finally out of routes and businesses regain confidence in future. We may reach our strategic targets even faster than we thought before the crisis hit the market in March., Now I’ll turn the word to Dmitry to walk you through the key highlights of the third quarter. Thank you., Dmitry Sergienkov, Thank you, and hello everyone. As Mikhail said in the third quarter, we continue and demonstrating a steady recovery across all major operating and financial measures. And it was done against the backdrop of continuous economic volatility. And specifically in terms of new CVs inflow we saw further improvements with double-digit year-on-year growth. Total number of CVs on the platform reached $48 million indicating net acquisition of circa 6 million CVs since the beginning of the year., And this new active audience acquisition coupled with our certain product improvements result in a growing number of applications I can see, which is one of the main efficiency criteria for our clients. And so we’ll enable our forward monetization improvement. Audience growth is vital, especially if put in the context of a rapidly recovering the employer activity until the beginning of September, the average daily number of job postings on the platform hold an historical high range of circa 720 – 740,000 vacancies. And again, that was despite the kind of worsening COVID-19 situation in autumn., We believe that we are actually one of very few job platforms globally that reached and even exceeded pre-crisis in entry level, because many of our peers globally struggling with services in during this time. Due to our constantly improving sort of recommendational algorithms, we’ve managed to sustain high conversions from application to invitations. It takes a without compromising compliant efficiency during this scale expansion., That encouraging dynamic in operating metrics during third quarter translated and sound set of financial results. Revenue grew 7.7% year-on-year, and our core Russian segment revenue grew even higher 9.1% year-on-year. And the difference is predominantly explained by the continuous political turbulence in Belarus., Our adjusted EBITDA margin was up to 56.1% from 53.5% in 2019, mainly due to relocation of a part of the marketing expenses the later of the year and some ongoing anti-crisis measures that were eventually lifted in the fourth quarter of 2020. CapEx adjusted on office renovation costs was around 2% and we put most of our capital expenditure initiatives on hold during this crisis., As to the performance by product type, please turn to Page five, as expected the most rapidly recovering product was job posting growing 11% year-on-year, as our key accounts resume the hiring post of down and the most importantly, a small medium business category bounce back after short fall in Q2. These dynamics will also supported by our aggressive promo targeted most affected market areas., Bundled subscriptions and other time proved to be highly stable and predictable part of our business. And despite, we are currently absorbing significant growth in new long-term contracts activations. It will take certain time before it finds a reflection revenue numbers. So you don’t see it in this numbers yet., CV database access being exposed more to a small medium segment buying one and seven days duration, finally return to growth as well. And we expect it to accelerate in Q4. Of course, there can be no impact from recent transition to a new subscriptions model yet. Although, we see first clients migrating to paper contracts, and so far we don’t see visible client insurance caused by this transition., Strong performance in value-added services mainly explained by high share of subscription-based long-term revenue and predominantly from key accounts acquiring various of branding products. We also saw uplift in a retail demand for our price performance product Virtual Recruiter that is driving a vast revenue share in total., Turning now to Q2 result by customer segment, if you can find on Page 6, 7, and 8. We saw revenue recovering to growth across all customer segments. Our customers the region of Russia were elegantly less impacted by the pandemic and keep growing faster than Moscow and St. Petersburg. Importantly, revenue growth was mostly driven by the increase in number of paying customers across all client categories, and that explained by intake of both new customers and customers returning post-crisis., Total number of customers grew more than 10% year-on-year. For key accounts, ARPC was affected by growing customer base as a set especially in the regions, therefore diluting average check for small and medium businesses apart from intake of new smaller customers, ARPC was affected by aggressive postal down promo. And we are actually convinced that this push for new customer acquisition will positively impact our revenue share going forward., And now here’s Grigorii talk about other financial metrics., Grigorii Moiseev, Thank you, Dmitry, and hello everyone. Let me give you some detail on the expenses and margins. In the third quarter of 2020, total operating expenses grew 8% year-on-year. This was primarily due to expenses related to our SPO, which occurred in July 2020. Our total adjusted operating expense, which excludes IPO SPO-related expenses equity-settled awards and other non-ordinary items were actually flat in the third quarter 2020 compared to the third quarter 2019., For convenience, we actually added to the adjusted operating expenses reconciliation table in our press release from this quarter and I will refer to the adjusted operating expenses in the discussion goal. So as I said, total adjusted operating expenses reflect year-on-year and this was the combination of several multidirectional factors. First, our personnel expenses adjusted for equity-settled awards and one off SPO-related expense $561 million, which was an increase by circa 9% year-over-year, mostly due to indexation of wages in the beginning of 2020, and an increase in headcount to 800 employees in the third quarter 2020 compared to circa 760 people in the third quarter of 2019., In 2020, in the third quarter, as we saw operating and financial performance during back on track, we have resumed usual bonuses for our employees, as well as listed our hiring spend however, some personnel expenses such as corporate events and trainings or education or still on hold partially for natural reasons. And now moving to marketing expense, as you saw from the release in the third quarter of 2020, marketing was to RUB235 million, which was decrease by a circa 20% versus marketing in the third quarter in 2019., Now this decrease was due to – purely due to different allocation of our TV campaign, as we have allocated significantly more ads to the second quarter and the less for the third quarter in this year compared to 2019. In the fourth quarter, we intend to spend more when we did in the third quarter, and as I think we discussed on a previous call, we stick to our plan that marketing expenses will be relatively flat in the second half of 2020 compared to the second half of 2019., And lastly, our other general and administrative expenses adjusted for SPO-related professional services and other financing and transactional costs were RUB208 million flat compared to a RUB203 million in the third quarter of 2019 and this percentage of revenue adjusted to other G&A were 9% relatively flat compared to 9.5% in the third quarter of 2019., So as a result, our adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of 2020 reached circa RUB1.3 billion, which is an increase by 13% compared to the third quarter of 2019. And our adjusted EBITDA margin has also expanded by circa 3 percentage points to 56.1% in the third quarter of 2020. Now move into CapEx, as Dmitry said before in the second quarter of 2020, we have substantially completed our large project on our Moscow office fit out. And as a result, our CapEx in the third quarter 2020 was RUB70 million, which is down by 29% versus previous year same quarter., And as a percentage of revenue, it was a historically a usual level of circa 2%, 3% of revenue, which was the usual level for us over the years. Our income tax expense increased by RUB73 million or by circa 38% compared to the third quarter of 2019, which was primarily due to increasingly effective tax rate to 31% and this was mainly because of the non-deductible SPO-related professional services and also the reversal of the provision for uncertain tax positions in the third quarter of 2019. Excluding these effects, the effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2020 would have been 28%., Now turning to cash generation metrics, which are on Page 11 in our supplementary slide deck. In the nine month 2020, we generated circa RUB2 billion from operating activities compared to approximately RUB1.7 billion in the nine month 2019. This increase mostly due to a decrease in interest rate on the back half of the decrease in the Key Rate of Central Bank of Russia to each our backlog and interest expenses tied to, and also a decrease in income tax paid and other changes in the working capital. Net cash used in investing activities was RUB181 million in the nine months 2020 compared to RUB494 million used in same period last year., And this was mostly driven by the acquisition of interest in Skilaz, which we completed in 2019. Net cash used in financing activities in the third – sorry, over the nine months 2020 was RUB2.7 billion compared to RUB2.3 billion in the nine months 2019. This change of RUB401 million was mainly due to an increase in annual dividend, which we paid in September 2020 and this increase was partly offset by repayment of the loan to an associate of the non-controlling shareholder in March 2019., As a result of these changes in cash, our net debt was RUB3.1 billion as of September 30, 2020, flat compared to RUB3 billion as of December 31, 2019. And the leverage also remained flat, and this currently 0.8 times EBITDA. Additionally, in the third quarter of 2020, we have agreed with B2B bank to extend the ultimate maturity of our debt from October 2022 to June 2025, as well as we agreed on temporarily relaxation of some performance covenants to account for COVID-19 impact on our performance, while interest rates on our credit facility remained unchanged., Thank you. And now, I’d like to open the floor for the Q&A., Question-and-Answer Session"

Welcome, everybody, and thank you for your time today., None, Peter Osvaldik, Well, absolutely. Thank you, Simon. And yes, it’s unfortunate that we’re not able to be in Barcelona, but we’re extremely excited to be here anyway today, and I’m pleased to join you. Thank you., So yes, let me start with just the good old disclaimer. So today, we will make some forward-looking statements during this conversation, including comments about the benefits we expect to receive from our merger with Sprint. Such statements involve a number of significant risks and uncertainties, including the risk factors set forth in our SEC filings. And of course, in addition, we cannot comment on Auction 107 because the quiet period, haven’t started. So thank you, again., Yes. Let me start with the key priorities as we head into year-end and into 2021. And really, we’re just continuing to execute against our plans with 3 drawn priorities that we played out that we expect to be critical to both the short-term and the long-term success of this company; the first one being to continue to consistently and profitably outgrow the competition. And you saw us continue to deliver on that in Q3, which included a high number of total net additions, a record high number for us as a company. While doing that, we also delivered strong profitability and increased guidance across the board for the second half. Number two is to unlock the value of the synergies faster and bigger than we anticipated. And this goes back to our focus on accelerating synergies beginning in Q2 and continuing throughout the year across both network, retail, marketing and back office, and now forecasting to hit $1.2 billion in synergies for 2020 and we expect to deliver more than $2.4 billion in 2021. And that is on an in-year basis that’s for run rate, not the exit. That implies the exit is even higher. And number three, make the necessary investments in the near term to position the company for long-term success. So as Mike always says, it’s not robbing from the future to make short-term results for it. And this is a key focus for us across the enterprise., Core to this is, of course, also the network, much like synergy captures where we’ve accelerated our build, and I’m sure we’ll speak more about that later today, but also making investments in growth opportunity areas, both within the core mobile wireless business, but also other key focus areas such as fixed wireless broadband and also focusing on cost transformation opportunities beyond synergies. So despite all of the macro uncertainty and challenges we’ve all faced this year, I couldn’t be more pleased with how these teams come together and delivered, and we are very excited to continue on this journey in Q4 2021., Question-and-Answer Session"

We are very happy to welcome everyone to our quarterly performance update, which is dedicated to the Nine Months and the Third Quarter 2020. My name is Alexey Yankevich. I’m the CFO of the company. Unfortunately, our Investor Relations team is partially in the lockdown. So I would do the introduction and disclaimer on behalf of Anna Sidorkina, who is connected but not in the main room right now., So I shall begin by introducing the speakers at today’s call. In terms of the financial reporting, it will be myself, as usual, giving you the information, respectively. And as far as the Upstream is concerned, we will hear from Igor Shkirov, who is in charge of the Economic division of the Upstream segment, followed by Nikita Anichkin, who oversees the economic part of Downstream, who will share with us events in the downstream logistics, refining and marketing. And then during the Q&A, we are going to be joined by various core stream representatives., And before we begin our presentation, I would like to yet again remind us that all of the comments and all of the statements that may be heard in the course of today’s conference call may contain, and will be of a -- outlook in nature about the financial standing and the results of Gazprom Neft’s operation, all of the statements, with the exception of the fact, may be considered of a forecast nature, which are the statements about the future expectations based upon the current environment. And the management assumptions may take into account known and unknown risks and uncertainties which may lead to the actual results and events considerably being different from the ones which were mentioned or referred to in the course of today’s telephone conversation., With that, let us begin. And so now we will follow with the main part of the presentation. In Q3, the Gazprom Neft company continued its operations in the pandemic environment, and our priorities remained caring for our employees, customers and clients, and we also did our best to offer maximum support and aid to the society, particularly in the regions where we operate. So and as far as this is concerned, our efforts traditionally focused in several directions, the first one being employees and running regular testing more than 800,000 tests to date, and maintaining social distancing and entire virus infrastructure at all of our facilities as well as continuing the practices of the buffer terminals as well as raising the awareness and using our own IT tools in order to maintain control over the access to our facilities., From the point of view of our partners and customers, we similarly offer a complex testing service trying to cover with our virus test, also the employees of our contractors as well as establishing the mechanism for support for the oil service companies so as to increase the contactless communications at our gasoline stations for individuals and legal entities and complying with all of the sanitary precautions. We continue our complex program for the support of the medical personnel in combating COVID-19, continuing to provide fueling to volunteers and helping and offering aid in the regions where we are present to fight the pandemic., I shall begin the presentation of the performance updates from such an important event in ESG area since Gazprom Neft joined the global UN initiative and, apart from improving the efficiency, is something that we’ve really been able to do a lot of good things. We are setting the task of the environmental agenda, putting an emphasis upon it very seriously. That includes reducing the greenhouse gas emissions, then improving the level of the operational safety, preventing the environmental emissions, then rehabilitation and preserving the biodiversity as well as reflecting the climate agenda in developing our project portfolio and in their assessment as well as using and developing green technologies., Amongst other priorities in our work also remain developing our human capital resource in the regions where we are present, so as to set up and develop intersectoral partnership. Now in terms of the quantitative outcome, principally speaking, the third quarter turned out to be quite successful, and most importantly, it sets a positive trend and positive dynamics. So overall, our financials throughout nine months looked in the following way., Our revenue amounted to RUB1.45 trillion. The adjusted EBITDA was about RUB330 billion and the net profit, RUB36 billion. So we came up very confidently into the black based on the results of nine months. As far as the production was concerned, we remained approximately at the level of last year. The refining went up by 2.9% as a consequence of the evolving market environment., In Q3, as opposed to Q2, as I said, we are now seeing a positive trend. Almost all of the indications grew. The revenue growth was about 35%. The adjusted EBITDA growth was 77%, and net profit, 27%, respectively. The amount of production went up by 1.2% as the result of the OPEC+ and the amount of refining grew by 15.7% as the consequence of the market recovering., With that, I will pass the floor over to my colleague, Igor Shkirov, from Upstream., Igor Shkirov, Yes, good afternoon. Slide number 8 with your permission. Production in Q3 declined as opposed to Q2 by 1.2%, which was quite logical because Q2 in a certain part covered April where we didn’t have any production restrictions, but nevertheless, we’re trying to do it in the most efficient way, and we are optimizing and we are looking at the -- where we deal with every challenge and the way we did it. We can see that this particular reduction falls upon the joint venture operations that we have., The next slide demonstrates the work we do in improving production efficiency. Another thing that is conducive to it is that our production grows from our new high efficient assets, which enables us to masterfully manage production under the OPEC+ reducing the production from the mature fields where the water cut is greater and the costs are higher., And these measures also enable us to reduce our average operational cost by 1 -- for 1 tonne of oil, and you can visually see it on the next Slide number 10, where we note in the middle that major projects enable us to reduce our ops by RUB44 per tonne at the same time, even despite the decline in production at the mature fields through the kind of measurement that we undertake, including our forms in our OpExes and the recovery of liquids. Nevertheless, we are able, despite the inflationary factor to maintain these costs at the level which do not exceed the nine months of 2019. A slight growth of our expenditures in terms of our overseas assets is related naturally to the production decline at the button field., The next Slide number 11, an undoubted focus in our attention is not only operational costs, but investments. In the first place, we took a very close look at the projects which contain higher risks and the ones which do not carry any returns to us in the immediate future, like the fracking projects, which we put on hold, which means that we are to complete the work that we started earlier, looking at the success of the projects and the way it fits into the new reality., And so from the planned projects, the decline in frac’s projects is going to be RUB9 billion only because our restrictions not only apply to the oil price, but also to the output volumes. Without that, we are reducing our investments into drilling, and we have already reduced them by about 30% as opposed to the beginning of the 2020, I mean, in terms of the crews deployed. And respectively, we are looking further at various trends as -- so as to predict activity., With respect to the major project, we are focusing upon reducing the cost to build infrastructure project and optimizing these particular expenditures without changing dramatically the period within which we are going to commence them into operation. We are very actively working on our technologies, which enable us to enjoy direct feedback and direct returns from our direct activities in the very immediate future with the lowest cost involved, disseminating and scaling out the successes that we achieved., Specifically during the previous call, we talked about the cluster technology where we build the wells stage by stage when we first do the first, the top part of it and then go further down. And then we complete all of the wells at the pad, and we can confidently talk about the results in terms of employing such technology, which reduced our drilling period by about 35% as well as run down the cost. And so the workover is also being reduced by about 35%, and so the cost is maintained at about 35%. And we’ll also introduce our technological solutions., So completing the upstream section, a couple of other words about the exploration work. We don’t stop our activity in terms of expanding our reserves, but we do that at a minimum possible cost involved, and this is additional coming in when we have an acreage that we do the fringes on it. And in this way, we’ve been able to achieve additional 20 million tonnes of recoverable reserves at approximately $3 per barrel as a cost. This is it for me. Thank you., Alexey Yankevich, Nikita, please., Nikita Anichkin, Good afternoon dear colleagues. I would like you to switch over to Slide number 15. And here, I would like to present to you the refining, logistics and marketing performance results over the nine months, so in Q3 compared to Q2. As you know, the market somewhat recovered, and so the Brent price went back by about 50%, but we do see that a lot of refining remains at the export character level, which is conditioned by a very slow recovery of the crack spreads for the refined product as well as the higher level of a tax burden. But at the same time, the refining efficiency overall throughout the company remains positive. That is being achieved through creating via protected sales channels, both in the small wholesale as well as in retail market., Next slide, please. So over to refining, the amount of refining, as was previously mentioned, in Q3, grew almost by 16%. This growth was possible thanks to the demand recovering for the motor fuels, very good demand in terms of the premiums channel in the domestic market, enabled us to optimize our product basket and efficiently achieve the refining as opposed to the second quarter. Similarly, the company continues to increase its refining depth so as to produce lighter products at the Moscow refinery. The main driver was the introduction of the EURO+, which we mentioned more than once before, and at the Omsk refining, the depth goes through the optimization of mixing between the light and darker products., And so practically, we completely ceased to produce to KM 16 in favor of more better margin – bunkering fuels with a better profit margin. In terms of the B2B segment, I should say that despite the pandemic and the lower demand at Gazprom Neft in 2020, gains is the market share in terms of the premium channels. It became possible through a number of efforts undertaken by the management amongst which, in Q3, you can take a look at the bitumen supplies that we entered into as an agreement with [indiscernible] and also for the sales of the insulation materials., And as far as the bitumen products are concerned, we have entered into a contract with the Tanaco company, which would really make it possible to supply this fueling deficit in various ports, and we also continue to gradually introduce various digital solutions for the jet fueling and in direct interaction with consumers., With respect to the motor fuel segment, the company, in terms of the B2B example also grows its presence amongst the drivers here, you can see the leasing of the new fuel distinction as well as the growth in average daily sales. And as far as this item is concerned, Gazprom Neft is a confident leader in the Russian market. The amount in one station is 18.6 tonnes per day. Apart from big volumes of throughput, we are also able to maintain and raise the low of our servicing., Over the past year, the rights of the consumers and the quality of services of the Gazprom Neft was awarded in two nominations, retail services in fueling stations and the choice of consumers in fueling. In conclusion, a few words about what we do in green energy. Gazprom Neft consistently continues to develop the alternative green sources of energy. I shall remind you that in the end of last year, we’ve launched the first module of the solar production at the Omsk refinery. Today, we have considered the possibility of using solar energy in order to make our fueling stations work. And in the reporting quarter – in the Yaroslav region, we had the first retail station, which works off the solid batteries. Apart from the environmental impact, better impact in the midterm perspective, that would give the company additional economic effect as we expect. This is it with me. Thank you very much for your attention., Alexey Yankevich, Dear, ladies and gentlemen, I’m now back with you about our financials. Let’s go over to the next slide. So basically speaking about the EBITDA and the net profit quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year, I’ve already mentioned it. And let me go over to a detailed factor analysis or the overall dynamics. So in as far as the annual dynamics you can spend in the nine months – or nine months last year, we can see the overall decline, but principally speaking, it is being dissected into two parts, which is the impact from the external environment, which has been seriously negative in the first place as a result of the oil and refined products prices going down., On top of it, there occurred a decline in volumes as a result of OPEC+ agreement. Besides, there is also an impact from the pandemic and specifically from the pandemic upon the domestic market and the Russian federation, which affected the refining volumes and the downstream operations as well. So there is a separate tax factor, which is about [indiscernible] of a field, which principally speaking as of 2020 started paying entity tax similarly because of the accumulated losses finished., And so respectively, the tax emerged, which we didn’t have last year, because there used to be historical losses, which were being compensated and the entity tax base was zero. But at the same time, we, as the management, tried our best to compensate for these, and respectively, in E&P, we were optimizing our expenses. We have optimized the volumes as part of the OPEC+ limitations. We’re trying to produce in the maximum efficiency way, which gave us additional RUB5 billion at the same time, optimization, logistics, marketing, refining and sales produced additional RUB23 billion, and there is also the maintenance factor, which, within this period, gave us an additional gain., So in terms of the intercorporate factors, we came up with additional RUB37 billion in as far as the EBITDA dynamics was concerned. The next slide demonstrates quarterly dynamics. Here, we can see certain gains as well, and the main factor was the prices recovering for oil and refined products, which produces about RUB60 billion. There is a slight consequence of OPEC+, which started in the second quarter, not in the very beginning., So we see a certain difference in between the second and the third quarter. And as far as the effect upon the downstream and the domestic market, this impact was positive because we saw certain recovery. And also in Q3, we continued working in optimizing our business processes and compared to Q second, we added additional RUB5 billion as a result of the internal factors., Next slide, please. Let me go over to the analysis of our capital investments. I believe this is the most interesting slide for you. What we can see here is that despite the fact that compared to last year’s nine months on nine months, we do know to slide, but nevertheless, growth of 0.5%. But simultaneously, in the quarterly dynamics, we do see that the kind of efforts that we’ve made in optimizing our investment programs that we discussed during the previous calls produced the results., And as you can see in the overall investment level going down in Q3 compared to Q2, so we’re definitely moving in the proper direction. So this reduction was about 25%, and that produces a very strong confidence that our target to optimize 20% compared to our business plan, which we announced previously, is quite feasible. So overall, during Q4, we expect price minus the level of the third quarter and maybe even lower., And as far as the annual dynamics is concerned, yet again, I shall remind you that this is related to the implementation of several major projects, without which we could have lowered it year-on-year, but there are such major project as Zapadno-Zimniy field as Tazovsky cluster as well as the oil fringes, and these projects, I shall remind us, remain profitable and generate good revenue even under the current prices. So it doesn’t make any sense to stop them. We continue working with them. Additionally, as far as Tazovsky is concerned, there is a one-off factor related to the fact that the transaction with deal with Shell didn’t happen., So we are funding it almost ourselves 100%. But we continue to actively work to bring in additional partners. We have certain interim results, and there are companies who are stating interest because the market is recovering, reviving itself. But unfortunately, that – Shell deal occurred at the very peak of the crisis. So right now, situation is improving. And so we definitely do estimate and expect that with a high level of probability, we’ll be able to find a partner, and these investments are going to be compensated for., The next slide, cash flows. Well, in this regard, we also promised you during the previous calls that we will make our best efforts to make the free cash flow into the positive because if you recall it was in negative, considering the half year results. Principally speaking, we’ve been able to be true to our words. And based on the results of nine months, we’re practically at zero. Those [indiscernible] RUB0.4 minus, but you can definitely [indiscernible] bearing in mind the fact that the net cash flow from the sale of the net assets, we can conditionally attribute to the free cash flow as well., So generally speaking, we did the proper work, and that is a consequence of the optimization of our investment program and the consequence of our control over the cost. So overall, our free cash flow amounted to approximately zero. And besides, we were able to reduce our credit portfolio, the net borrowings minus RUB22 billion. And despite such complex times, we found the possibility, and we paid quite a significant amount of dividends, RUB93 billion and are running a little bit at – that there is an extraordinary Annual Shareholders’ Meeting is supposed to endorse our dividend payment based on the nine-month result., So in terms of the dividends, we are true to all of our commitments. And then the deposits, there is an FX factors, which bring minus 59 of the net cash flow, but negative because of the RUB93 billion of dividend paid, without which the cash flow would have been positive., Next slide. I shall round up my presentation. I’m showing the slides about our financial stability. While our financial status remains a very good one, principally, we do demonstrate a very good resilience in terms of both liquidity as well as the ability to pay different categories of our banking obligations. The average maturity has grown from 3.18 to 3.23 as of September, and the average interest rates in – from 6% went down to 5.8% as of September 30. That is a very good rate. A very well-balanced portfolio in terms of its maturities. And the ratings have been confirmed by almost all the rating agencies at the investment-grade level, which makes us confident that we can believe that we have survived through the most acute crisis phase and are going to further recover., And so to wrap up, I can tell you that all of our plans and commitments remain as they are. The company is operating very smoothly. We don’t have any major outbreaks. So we do work according to our schedule. Thank you very much for your attention. And now we are ready to switch to Q&A session., Question-and-Answer Session"
23875,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4390518-halmas-hlmaf-ceo-andrew-williams-on-half-year-results-2020-21-earnings-call-transcript,"Andrew Williams – Group Chief Executive Officer, Member of Executive Board & Executive Director, Marc Ronchetti – Group Chief Financial Officer & Executive Director","Andre Kukhnin – Credit Suisse, Michael Tyndall – HSBC, Andrew Wilson – JPMorgan, Mark Davies Jones – Stifel, Robert Davies – Morgan Stanley, Andrew Williams, Well, good morning, everyone, and welcome to Halma's Half Year Results Presentation. It was back in July at our full year results announcement that we gave you an insight on how we are responding to the global pandemic. We gave you a greater understanding of how we saw the financial year panning out, but also that shared confidence in our ability to create value in a sustainable way for all our stakeholders., And I'm pleased to say that the half year has gone to plan. In fact, we made progress very much in line with our expectations. If anything we're ahead of where we thought we'd be, demonstrating once again Halma's resilience. So today, you're going to get a reminder of what drives that resilience. You're going to gain an insight into the impact COVID has had on our markets within each sector, but also through that, you'll see the benefit of the diversity of our markets. And finally, you'll understand how COVID has accelerated our decisions on organizational investment priorities for the second half albeit reinforcing the value of our purpose and our growth strategy., So what do we mean by resilient by design because it doesn't happen by chance, Halma is resilient because it's systemic. It incorporates several key components, which are interdependent with one another. And it starts with that clear and positive purpose, which is both ambitious and inclusive, growing a safer, cleaner, healthier future for everyone, every day. And I'll give you example in my strategic review about how we are living our purpose, both in terms of our broader campaigns, our global campaigns, as well as day-to-day within our business., Next, we've got a focused and sustainable growth strategy to grow and acquire businesses in global niche markets aligned with our safety, health, and environmental goals with long-term growth drivers. And that growth is funded by the cash that we generate through our operating companies. But all of that needs to be supported by a robust and agile organization and a strong culture. We defined as Halma’s DNA. And that gives us the agility, but also it gives us agility through the local autonomy, local accountability of the operating companies., It means we've got to have a strong investment in leadership at all levels so that when the crisis comes like a global pandemic, people know what they need to do and how they should do it without having to have every decision made at the center or indeed controlled by the center. And we've seen the value of all of these elements during the first half of the year. Two thirds of our operating company of our facilities had some sort of mandate to stay operational through the lockdown period due to the critical nature of their products and services. Just three out of our 53 operating facilities had any sort of extended lockdown period and all have been operational since July., I think it's worth at this point, just recognizing the great work that our manufacturing teams have put in during this period, because they've been working in our facility throughout the period while many of us have been working at home. And they have to adapt to new ways of working. They have to ensure that customer needs are met. I've been hugely impressed with the way they've responded to those challenges, proud of what they achieve and would like to say that they've certainly led the way in living our purpose across the group. We want to thank them for the efforts that they've made. Because it's through their efforts and indeed these elements that make us resilient, that's enabled us to perform well during the first half of the year and have confidence in the future., So already you've heard the word resilient quite a lot during this presentation. And I think this slide will just summarize what we mean by that. So despite the huge variations in conditions across regions, across markets, revenue was only 5% lower than last year at £618 million. Our rapid response to the emerging pandemic, by reducing our costs significantly in the first quarter and then controlling our spend in the second quarter was protected our profitability such that profit is also only 5% lower than last year at £122 million. And collectively that has ensured we've maintained our return on sales at 19.7% exactly in line with last year and well within our 18%, 22% KPI target range., We've seen exceptionally strong cash generation by our operating companies. It was one of our priorities at the start of the half year to have strong cash generation and maintain strong liquidity. So we ended the period with net debt reduced from £375 million to £315 million at the end of September, which is around one times EBITDA. And we had available liquidity at the September just under £500 million, which is an improvement from £431 million at the end of the last financial year. As relative to this and our resilient trading and commerce in the future, we're increasing our interim dividend by 5%, which will position us well to continue our 40 plus year track record of increase in full year dividends by 5% or more., And finally, I was encouraged by the improved momentum and confidence across our business, improving as the half year progressed. So we saw a sequential revenue growth in the second quarter of 11% above the first quarter. And although you'll see quite large year-on-year variations in Marc's presentation, it's actually more to do with the variation we saw last year than this year. In fact, this year, the revenue trends after we went through the very challenging first quarter, since then the revenue trends have shown more of a gradual monthly improvement., So after that initial decline, it's felt like a well-managed period of progress with companies delivering on their short-term forecast and then gradually increasing their full year expectations. That confidence is also exemplified by the healthy rate of R&D investment we've seen during the period. So that has increased to 5.6% of revenue albeit of that slightly lower revenue base. And lastly, it's been pleasing to see the level of M&A activity picking up strongly during the second quarter, and that's continued into the second half., So we've seen a good mix of new as well as old opportunities. There's opportunities that maybe were put on hold as lockdown came in. We've also seen a wide range of valuation expectations, but despite that our criteria remain the same. We're looking for high quality companies with valuable intellectual property, serving niches in global markets, which are aligned with our purpose., So before Marc's financial review, a brief summary of how we are looking forward to the future and also how we perform during this first half. Our resilience has enabled us to continue to create value for all of our stakeholders, both internally and externally. And it's also ensured that we perform better than we expected during the first half of the year. We've seen improved trading, but also improved investment by operating companies and that has continued into the second half of the year. As a result of all of this, we're increasing our expectations to the top of the guidance we gave at the full year and we now believe profit for this year will be around 5% below last year., Now, before I give you the strategy update, I hand over to Marc, who will take you through the financial results in more detail., Marc Ronchetti, Thank you, Andrew, and good morning everyone. As we've heard from Andrew, we've delivered a resilient performance in the first half of the year. Our response to COVID-19 enabled us to maintain high returns, deliver a strong cash performance and maintain a strong financial position to support continued investment for future growth. For me, this reinforces the benefits of our clear purpose and strong culture, our agile and responsive business model and the long-term growth drivers in our end markets., Let's take a more detailed look at the drivers behind this performance, starting with group revenue. And working from left to right, as you can see, revenue decreased to 11% on organic constant currency basis. And again, as Andrew has mentioned, there was a wide variation of performance among our individual companies, reflecting significant changes in demand and individual end markets and geographies, which impacted each of the sectors differently. I'll pick up on those key drivers as part of the individual sector reviews. That said the overall resilience of the group result reflects the benefit of our structure as a portfolio of diverse companies., Looking at sequential trends, it was positive to see an improvement in Q2 with revenue up 11% on Q1. Acquisitions contributed a healthy 6% to revenue growth reflecting the record 10 acquisitions made during the last financial year. We expect this contribution to reduce to circa 3% in H2 given the timing of the acquisition completions. There were small negative impacts from disposals and currency, and this completes our bridge to our reported revenue decline of 5.4%., Looking at our revenue performance by destination, which more so than in previous periods, has been driven by the shape of the underlying sector performances. The chart on the left shows the reported revenue split by destination in addition to the reported growth by region, with the chart on the right showing the regional organic constant currency growth. Given the limited impact of currency in the period, acquisitions account for most of the difference between our reported and our organic constant currency revenue. It's picking up on a few headlines and starting with revenue growth in the USA, which remains our largest sales destination, the growth driven by strong organic performance in Environmental & Analysis, and a positive contribution from acquisitions made last year. This growth was partially offset by organic constant currency declines in our medical and two safety sectors., Moving to the UK, which was our weakest region with revenue declines driven by the two largest sectors in the region, Infrastructure Safety and Environmental and Analysis, while process safety demonstrated a more resilient performance. The decline in Asia Pacific revenue reflected growth in China of 1% offset by falls in India, Malaysia and Singapore, largely due to the timing of large projects in addition to the impact of COVID-19 in these regions. The 1% headline growth in China included a strategic move away from low margin revenue in our Infrastructure Safety sector, without which growth would have been circa 4%. Sequentially, China revenues were 16% up in Q2 on Q1., Switching now to adjusted profit, again working from left to right. Organic constant currency profit down 11%, in line with revenue, a positive performance maintaining return on sales through a combination of continued strong gross margin; and a reduction in overheads including the discretionary cost reduction of over £20 million in the first quarter compared to our Q4 run rate and our ongoing overhead controls. However, importantly, we also continued strategic investment for future growth., We were also pleased to be able to maintain return on sales despite the impact of our decision to self-fund a small percentage of our workforce furloughed by their companies, circle £2 million. Additionally, we provided enhanced financial support to a small number of employees who were affected by unavoidable redundancies, at a cost of around £2 million in addition to the local operating company payments., There was a strong contribution from acquisitions, reflecting good margins in businesses we have acquired in the last year, while disposals were a very small positive. In line with revenue, we expect to see a reduced contribution from acquisitions in the second half, to circa 3%. There was a small impact from currency translation for the period and we expect this to reverse in the second half, leading to a minimal impact for the year as a whole. This completes the bridge to the headline profit decline of 5.3%., To put some color on the Group performance, I will now take you through more detail at the sector level. As I stated earlier, there has been wide variation in performance across the portfolio, and it is also worth remembering that when looking at a six-month period, we can often get large percentage movements on what are relatively immaterial absolute movements., So starting with Infrastructure Safety, we saw revenue down 13%. This included a 3% contribution from the acquisitions of Ampac and FireMate in the prior financial year. , Organic constant currency revenue declined 16%., From a sub-sector perspective, People & Vehicle flow delivered a resilient performance with an agile shift in product mix away from sliding door sensors, which are predominantly associated with construction work and retail refurbishment, towards the retrofit of sensors to automate swing doors and other touchless entry activation devices., Fire, security and elevator safety were the most impacted by the challenge of customers gaining physical access to installation sites during lockdowns and the subsequent furloughing of installers, particularly in the first quarter. The second quarter saw a significant improvement after lockdown restrictions eased, as installers returned to work and customers restocked. The trends in the sub-sectors ultimately came through in the revenue by destination., To highlight the two largest geographical movements, the UK, down 20%, was particularly impacted by site access and furlough challenges. The decline in Asia was driven by the timing of large projects and the implementation of our plans to exit lower margin business within Elevator Safety, in addition to the underlying impact of COVID-19., Our prior year acquisitions, both based in Australia, made an excellent contribution in Asia, taking reported revenue in the region to a decline of only 1%. Really positive to see return on sales improve to 22.8%, mitigating in part the revenue decline, with profit down 12% to £46 million, including 15% organic constant currency decline and 4% growth from acquisitions., The improved return on sales was driven by strong overhead control and higher gross margins due to effective management of product and geographic mix., R&D expenditure of £12 million was maintained at a good level and represented 6.1% of revenue in line with last year., So looking ahead, the sector is expected to make further progress in the second half and deliver a resilient full year performance, with continued strategic investment in longer-term growth opportunities. The timing of acquisitions will mean they will have less of a positive impact on growth rates in the second half., Moving now to Process Safety, where revenue declined by 10%, including an organic constant currency decline of 17%. We saw significant revenue declines driven by the decline in demand for safety products in U.S. onshore oil and gas related businesses, particularly within our Pressure Management sub-sector., In addition, Industrial Access Controls also saw significant declines, largely due to a strong prior year comparative, which included a large logistics contract. These declines were offset in port on a reported level by a positive 7% contribution from the U.S.-based acquisition of Sensit Technologies in the prior year. Again, this ultimately plays out in the revenue by destination, with the significant declines in Pressure Management and Industrial Access control impacting the U.S.A., in addition to the positive contribution of the Sensit acquisition., Great to see revenue growth in Europe, which was driven by Safe Storage and Transfer fulfilling larger projects, some of which had been in the order book prior to the start of the financial year., Return on sales decreased to 18.2%, resulting in profit declining by 55% to €17 million. This includes a 37% organic constant currency decline and a 4% positive contribution from the Sensit acquisition. The significant drop in profit was driven by three areas: a reduction in gross margin following the decline in high-margin U.S. onshore oil and gas revenue; the phasing impact of the large logistics contract; and one-off restructuring costs in the period of £1.7 million. Which when all combined, these exceeded the benefits from the action taken on overhead costs during the period., The sector continued to invest in key areas for the future, such as connected monitoring solutions, with R&D investment of £4.5 million representing 4.9% of revenue. Looking ahead, despite the ongoing challenges, especially in the oil and gas market, the sector is expected to continue the gradual improvement in trading we saw as the first half progressed. The continued investment in connected technologies and the growth potential of our products outside of the oil and gas market is expected to improve performance in the longer term., So moving now on to environments and analysis, which I am pleased to report continues to perform strongly, with revenue increasing by 1% to £154 million. The sector performance reflected strong growth in the Photonics sub-sector, driven by the phasing of a continuing large contract in the USA. This is one example of our Photonics companies seeing increasing demand for their technology in applications related to building digital and data capabilities for the digital world., We also saw growth in our gas flowmeter business, Alicat, rapidly adopting its technology to make components to meet urgent new requirements from ventilator companies in response to COVID-19. This was just one of many great examples of the benefits of the individual company agility within our operating model. This growth was in part offset by the disruption caused by COVID-19 on our water companies, in addition to the delayed demand from the UK water utilities due to the start of a new five-year regulatory investment cycle., Again, the sub-sector trends con be seen in the revenue by destination result. With the impressive U.S. growth, our results of the Photonics and gas flow meter growth, and the decline in the UK reflecting the water companies’ performance., Return on sales saw on impressive improvement from 20.5% to 24.9%, primarily due to pro-active cost management, including in response to COVID-19. This was a fantastic example of our companies individually contributing to the overall challenges faced by the Group., R&D expenditure of £8.3 million was maintained at a good level, although this represents a reduction to 5.4% of sales, largely a result of the phasing of investment. As a result, profit increased by 22% to £38 million., Looking forward, the sector is expected to perform well for the year as a whole, although a very strong prior year comparative will mean that growth rates will be reduced compared to the levels in the first half, with return on sales in the second half expected to return to recent historic levels. While water markets should continue to recover, we expect lower demand for ventilator components and the timing of photonics projects to moderate full year growth., Turning now to Medical, where revenue increased by 3% to £172 million, with an organic constant currency decline of about 11% and a large 15% positive contribution from acquisitions, with six of the prior year acquisitions being in the Medical sector. There was a very strong trend of significant increases in demand for products and services related to the diagnosis or treatment of COVID-19, with dramatic decreases in products and services related to elective healthcare procedures., Consequently, our Patient Assessment companies along with Perma Pure and Maxtec in the acute therapeutics subsector, delivered a very strong performance. At the other end of the spectrum, we saw declines in our ophthalmology, sensors and analytics and fluid diagnostics businesses due to sharp declines in elective procedures and a lock of physics I access to hospitals. These headline trends were consistent across the sector’s major markets, with the U.S.A., in particular, benefitting from the acquisition contribution at a reported level., Return on sales declined to 22.1% despite the overhead actions taken in the sector. This decline was driven by a reduction in gross margin due to mix, with the growth in the period coming from the lower gross margin sub-sectors and the declines within the higher gross margin sub-sectors., R&D spending, at £9.4 million, increased to 5.5% of revenue, demonstrating the confidence of our medical businesses in the long-term growth prospects in their market niches. This led to a profit decline of 3% to £58 million., Looking forward, prior year acquisitions are expected to have a smaller impact on reported revenue growth in the second half, due to the timing of the acquisition. On an underlying basis, as the financial year has progressed, we have seen a gradual improvement in demand for products and services related to elective healthcare procedures. And although the demand for COVID-19 related products is expected to moderate, the sector is expected to deliver a resilient performance in the second half., So looking now at net debt, in overall, I’m very pleased in performance on cash during the period, one which gives us a robust balance sheet and provides significant liquidity moving forward. Highlighting the key headlines, cash conversion was exceptionally high at 111%, significantly ahead of our KPI of 85%. This reflected an underlying strong performance on working capital, wider cash conservation measures, tax payment phasing and the cash impacts of a decline in revenue during the period., We saw an inflow from working capital, reflecting a combination of good debt collections across the group, alongside an overall reduction in debtors and creditors due to the decrease in revenue. Working capital also included the phasing benefits associated with the UK and U.S. government COVID-19 initiatives, namely the deferral of £4 million VAT payment in the UK into the second half and the deferral of U.S. employer payroll taxes of £4 million, which will be paid over the period to December 2022., To date, we’ve recorded very little bad debt, and we’ve continued to pay our suppliers on a timely basis. That said, we continue to see an enhanced bad debt risk going into the second half of the year and have maintained our bad debt provision at a similar level to that at the year-end and continue to hold the additional £5 million provision at the group level., Looking forward, we do not expect H2 cash conversion to remain at the exceptional levels seen in H1, but full year cash conversion should remain above our KPI of 85%. With no new M&A in the period, acquisition cash outflows were limited to payments of contingent consideration relating to acquisitions made in prior years. We paid £38 million in dividends continuing our policy of delivering progressive and sustainable returns to shareholders., Finally, in relation to other cash movements, we’ve included more detail, including 2021 financial year guidance in the appendix slides. We, therefore, ended the period with net debt of £315 million. This represents a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of approximately 1 times, well within our typical operating range of up to 2 times gearing. We, therefore, continue to have a robust financial position, strong cash generation and substantial available liquidity of circa £500 million, an over £300 million of capacity within an operating range of up to 2 times gearing., So to conclude, looking at our performance against our financial KPIs, whilst we delivered a resilient performance in the period, our revenue and profit growth rates were behind our financial targets given the challenges faced due to the COVID-19 pandemic. That said, it’s really positive to see we maintained high returns and continued investment for future growth with all four of the KPIs at the bottom half of the slide exceeded., We continue to believe that our existing financial KPI targets remain appropriate for the group in the medium to long-term. And to sum up, a resilient performance in the period, reflecting our flexible and agile business model and the benefits of our diverse portfolio focused on markets with long-term growth drivers and the essential nature of many of our products and services., I’ll now hand you back to Andrew for a strategy update., Andrew Williams, Thank you, Marc. Well, to finish, although there’s been an inevitable focus on short-term issues, I think the last six months has also really acted as – given us a strong reinforcement of both our purpose and also of the value of our growth strategy. And now I’d like to take a few moments just to give you three examples, and the three examples, which are also very well aligned with three key elements of Halma’s DNA., So we’re going to look at an organizational change that we are making, which ensures that we continue to be structured for growth. We also then want to share with you how we’re going to be accelerating our investment for the future, particularly focused on technology, and then finish off with talking a little bit around how we are living our purpose, both within the operating companies and across the group and really looking at the social aspects within the whole ESG agenda., Taking over the last couple of years, I’ve always known that at some point we’d eventually align our operating structure with our purpose and with our three key market focus areas of safety, environment and health care. And our experience during the pandemic has, particularly when we think about its impacts on the world, has meant that we brought those plans forward. We’re bringing those plans forward so that from the 1st of April of 2021 we’re both going to report and operate as three sectors., So as a combined safety sector, combining Process Safety and Infrastructure Safety, a separate Environmental & Analysis sector, and then finally, a Medical sector. We need new sector chief executives. And these positions will be filled by internal promotions of two of our existing divisional CEOs. I’m very pleased to see the work that we’re doing to develop leadership talent really paying dividends in situations like this., So our safety sector will be led by Wendy McMillan, replacing Adam Meyers, who as you know, is retiring in 2021. Our Environmental & Analysis sector will be led by Constance Baroudel. And then finally, Laura Stoltenberg will continue the excellent work she’s doing as sector Chief Executive of our Medical sector. There’s only one change in our portfolios across the three sectors, with our two gas detection businesses, Crowcon and Sensit, transferring across from Process Safety into the Environmental & Analysis sector, which really reflects where we see their long-term growth opportunities., We’ll give you a full analysis and the historical numbers under the new three sector heading and how we – the translation from four sectors to three, as certainly before the year begins, most likely with our March trading update. I think it’s important to recognize that this change is important, that it really rebalances our resources according to where we see our growth opportunities., And in particular, recognizing the acquisition growth opportunities in Environmental & Analysis are very different to the opportunities we see in Medical. And by having a dedicated team in each of those two sectors, I believe it’s going to enable us to sustain growth in the longer-term. So then we think about where are we investing for the future and particularly technology. I talked earlier in the year about our intention to invest more in our operational and strategic technology., And again, I think the past six months have only amplified that decision, when we think about how technology is transforming our working lives, but also the ways in which business need to provide their services and products to their customers. So we’re accelerating those plans, and we’re accelerating those plans by investing in some carefully selected areas. We’re going to be investing around £10 million of CapEx over the next three years, and then adding around £2 million of OpEx to support that investment., What do we mean by the investment? Well, there’s two main areas: the operational and the strategic. So the operational technology initiatives are going to be about modernizing the ways of working across the group, so that we can all do business in a more technology-enabled way. And the strategic initiatives will enable Halma companies to move to new digital business models in line with the Halma 4.0 growth strategy by building a common approach to IoT, the Internet of Things. And it will also help them to more easily commercialize the ideas, including those ones that are created by working with Inken Braunschmidt, Innovation and Digital team., So turning first to those operational technology investments. There are three areas. The first one is we’re going to build an enhanced core IT services. So we’re going to be upgrading our communication, collaboration, security technology to ensure we’ve got the right foundations to support how we work and how we want to grow in the future. And that’s an important initiative because it underpins all the other investments we’ll be making., Then we’ve got the HQ digital transformation program. So that’s delivering critical changes to our systems at the group level, to improve our consolidation and operational efficiency across our core group functions, such as finance, HR, sustainability and legal functions. And then finally, we’ve got the Architecture Center of Expertise initiatives. And that’s about creating and sharing best practice across the group companies, providing them with that guidance they need., And really, it’s important that we recognize is about what’s right for each business. So it’s about helping each business choose the right kind of business application or technology architecture across their key business operations, whether it’s ERP, CRM, e-commerce, finance, HR, business intelligence, they all need help, and we can give them that expertise from the center., And then strategically, there are two core initiatives. And it’s worth remembering that we’re not starting from scratch here. We’ve been working with external IoT partners for a couple of years. And we’ve also been researching what the leading benchmark companies do. So the IoT Center of Expertise, in that, we’re going to actually build a platform solution to help Halma companies get to market sooner with their connected solutions., And then on the Software Center of Excellence, we’re going to complement the IoT Center of Excellence by providing those companies with critical software development capabilities because many of our businesses, particularly those that perhaps mechanically based products or electromechanically based products, do not have that software expertise, and they struggle to gain access to it. So by having that at the center, we can give them the capabilities that they so badly need., And when you look at that in the range, you can see that not only we’re accelerating the pace of investment, but we’re doing it in a way which is going to be fast and agile, consistent with our overall approach. We’re going to be addressing the actual needs of each business rather than doing what we just think they do need. And we’re going to make sure it’s properly resourced. So that’s going to be a combination of internal resource, but also finding the right external partners., And all of this is just going to help us be more connected with each other, but most importantly connected with our customers, both in terms of our product solutions and our operations. So finally, want to look at living our purpose and what that means. I mean, we – when you think about the ESG agenda, clearly, we are continuing to push ahead with our environmental initiatives. And we’ll talk – no doubt, talk about that in more detail later in the year. But for this presentation, I want to focus on the social aspects of ESG in two different ways because that is very much aligned with one of our key elements of Halma’s DNA, which is leading our purpose., And firstly, I’m delighted to share with you details of Halma’s new global charitable campaign, Water for Life, which is a two-year campaign with our partner, WaterAid. It follows the success of Gift of Sight. You remember that over the last couple of years, we’ve had a project which ultimately ended up restoring the sight of hundreds of people at Ghana as well as giving free eye tests to Halma employees using Halma technology., So what are we going to do? Well, first of all, it is a program which is aligned with our purpose and with our sustainable development goals. In this case, good health and well-being and also clean water and sanitation. And our goal is to build and provide clean water for 8,000 people in Northern India. And we’re going to do that by supporting the WaterAid team on the ground. With funding, we’re going to raise at least £200,000 but also by donating our water testing technologies from one of Halma Company’s paling test, which can help prevent contaminated water supply., So our operating companies are not only going to help us with the fundraising, but also be encouraged to find ways to sustainably reduce their water usage, both at work and also at home. And again, it’s another great initiative just like Gift of Sight, which brings our purpose to life. It engages employees. It helps communities in needs, and it uses Halma’s technology to solve real-world problems. So I’m really looking forward to giving you updates on this program – this campaign as we go through the next couple of years., So let’s move across then from a big campaign to what we’re doing to live our purpose for everyone, every day, which is again a key element of our purpose because it’s not just about the large campaigns. I think one thing that struck me, again, over the last six months is that we’ve seen more examples of this in action across the group. And I’d like to share a few examples of that with you., Firstly, we see many examples of how our companies are helping external stakeholders through the pandemic. Many of our companies have been engaging with their local health care facilities and repurposing resources to make PPE to help in their response to the COVID pandemic. We’ve also seen companies, while focusing strongly on cash generation, to make sure they continue to supply – support their supply chain by ensuring they pay suppliers in a timely fashion. We’ve been ensuring that health, well-being and development of our employees., Our operating companies have been collaborating to make their workplaces safe, sharing best practice, expanding their manufacturing footprints to maintain safe social distancing. So in many cases, with colleagues in the offices, working from home, the manufacturing teams have taken over some of that office space and manufacturing. Or if that’s not been enough, they’ve actually been working with sister companies to share spare capacity., At the group level, we set up online, telephone support help lines through our external partners to offer mental health and other legal and financial support for all employees. And we significantly expanded our online virtual training development program for our employees, too. And finally, we’ve maintained our investment in our Halma Future Leaders program this year, which brings the best young graduate talent from across the world into the group. And I think it’s particularly important at this time that we continue to invest in younger talent in our business., And finally, we’ve seen some great examples of the progress we’re making in building an inclusive culture. We recently have launched a new global parental leave policy, which provides 14 weeks pay for all parents in all situations. That’s covering all 7,000 plus employees across the world in over 20 countries, and in many cases, significantly exceeds the support that people can get within the country where they live., We continue to build the inclusive culture through our Accelerate Inclusion online initiative. It’s a tool which both educates and gives practical tips and encouragement to all of our employees to ensure that we all work together to make Halma a place where everyone is included and able to contribute their best. And finally, our progress in terms of increased diversity in our leadership team is reflected in the fact that we’ve exceeded all Hampton-Alexander target at all three levels of our leadership group, so that’s at the PLC level, the Executive Board level and the Executive Board minus one level., And you look at that list, it’s hugely encouraging to be able to share so many examples of what the S in ESG means in Halma, and I believe it’s becoming an increasingly important component of our sustainable success in the future., So let’s finish and summarize what we’ve heard this morning. Halma’s success and confidence in the future comes from tangible qualities, tangible characteristics that we have. We are resilient by design. It’s in our purpose, our growth strategy, our chosen markets with long-term growth drivers and our relentless focus on developing an agile organization with a strong culture and developing talent as we grow., This has enabled us to continue to deliver sustainable value creation for all our stakeholders, not just financially for employees and shareholders, but also in practical support we’re giving to our local communities and also in the solution we provide for our customers. From a trading point of view, we’ve delivered a better-than-expected first half and our trading momentum has improved as the year has progressed., And we’re improving the momentum in our investment as well. So we continue to invest as we grow. Our operating companies were increasing their R&D investment. We’re investing – continuing to invest in our future leaders program. We talked about the investment in technology, and we will increase our investment in M&A in the year ahead after a quiet first half period., So as a result of all of the above, we’re increasing our expectations for the full year towards the higher end of previous guidance, and we now expect adjusted profits for the year to be around 5% below last year, and we look forward to the year ahead and the longer-term with confidence., That’s the end of today’s presentation. Now I’d like to hand over to the analysts as we have time for questions., Question-and-Answer Session"

Thank you for joining our 2020 third quarter earnings call. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to make headlines globally, I'd like to start on this topic to provide some context to this call. As much of the world see the resurgence of coronavirus cases and the continued economic downturn as a result, China has been one of the few bright spots with the pandemic successfully under control and the economy is starting to pick up., In addition to being something to be celebrated in its own right, the economic recovery in China has also created a positive environment for our operations. However, as a company and a country, we continue to stay vigilant for any new wave of infections. I want to thank the staff of 111 for their diligent dedication to meeting the needs of our customers and consumers and all healthcare workers and the scientists for their unwavering determination in this long fight against the pandemic. And before diving into the numbers, a couple of corporate news I'd like to update you on., Firstly, Mr. Luke Chen, until recently CFO of 111 has been appointed CFO of Yao Fang Information Technology in Shanghai, the 111's subsidiary preparing for listing on Shanghai Stock Exchange's STAR board. We thank Luke for his work, setting a strong financial foundation for 111 and believe that in his new position, he will guide Yao Fang to a strong growth trajectory and successful IPO. In the meantime, in addition to my role as CEO, I will step in as acting CFO alongside Luke during the transition until a new CFO is appointed., Secondly, on September 24, 111 hosted our third annual China Online Healthcare Summit and Partnership Conference, which attracted around 600 guests globally, including executives from leading pharmaceutical and healthcare companies, medical experts, government leaders and investment institutions. This conference paved participants the opportunity to discuss the various challenges facing the healthcare industry in China as well as the innovations been developed to tackle these challenges., 111 was able to take this opportunity to showcase our omni-channel platform that is transforming the healthcare industry by digitally connecting patients with medicine and our healthcare services. During the conference, we also announced several strategic partnership agreements, including the pharmaceutical companies, Bayer Healthcare, Novartis China, Xiangxue Pharmaceutical and Huluwa Pharmaceutical, as well as with insurance company Shanghai Uniondrug., These partnerships will leverage each company's expertise to advance innovation through partnerships. These partnerships will leverage each company's expertise to advance innovation and through 111's omni-channel platform, consumers will be able to conveniently access high quality healthcare products at a time and in a manner that fits into their busy schedules. I will provide more detail shortly., Moving on to our Q3 earnings results. The agenda today will cover an overview of the Company's business and operational performance, which you can find in Section 1 of the deck. We will then review the Company's financial performance in Section 2. We will end with guidance for Q4 before opening the call for Q&As. Let's begin. We're pleased to report that we have delivered another quarter of stellar growth., As you can see from Slide 4, this is the eighth consecutive quarter of revenue growth since our IPO, where we have been consistently delivering near or above three-digit -- triple-digit growth. Non-GAAP net loss as a percentage of net revenue continued to narrow from approximately 10% in Q3 2019 to 4% this quarter, showing momentum towards profitability. Net revenue increased 113% to reach RMB2.36 billion, while gross profit rose 90% to RMB90 million., We believe the robust performance is a strong validation of the successful execution of our multifaceted growth strategy to accomplish our mission. We have made solid progress enhancing our digital capabilities, our cloud-based solutions in the areas of patient management, doctor-patient interaction, education for doctors, patients and pharmacists and other related services received excellent response from our customers. Our smart supply chain management is making our operation more and more efficient., The omni-channel drug commercialization platform is laying solid foundation for our future growth in one of China's fastest growing industries. Over the last few quarters, we made a significant progress in strengthening the infrastructure of our digital healthcare platform that brings together key stakeholders in the healthcare ecosystem, retail pharmacies, online platform partners, doctors, insurance companies and the pharmaceutical companies to the benefit of all., For our retail pharmacy customers, part of our 300,000 strong network and the largest in China, our smart sourcing system, machine-learning and cloud-based solutions translate into effective sourcing, better inventory management, optimal product assortment, and a broader market reach, resulting in greater cost efficiency, higher earnings potential and an enhanced ability to serve our end consumers., For doctors, our smart technology puts the power of the latest medical innovations in their hands to achieve better health outcomes for their patients. For patients, our holistic disease management platform gives them access to the best doctors across the country, follow-up consultations, disease education materials, medication guides and the benefits of obtaining medications at home through our e-prescription service. The other important part of the infrastructure is the virtual pharmacy network that we have been working hard to build over the last three years., This segment of the business is showing particularly strong growth. The retail pharmacy sector continues to be highly fragmented and dominated by family-run storefronts. We see a vast opportunity to enable these business owners with better supply chain and technology solutions. We have aggressively grown this network over the last three years, which surpassed the 300,000 retail pharmacies as of the reporting date, representing a 43% increase from the third quarter of 2019 and over half of all retail pharmacies in China., Having achieved our goal of building the largest virtual pharmacy network in China, we will not be providing the number of retail pharmacies in our future earnings reports. Another validation of our strategy is to increase further strategic partnerships, based on the value we've demonstrated. For pharmaceutical companies, 111's smart supply chain management and cloud-enabled digital tools together with the marketing and patient support services we provide, help them gain access to a wider customer base and at a lower cost., In return, not only do we earn fees for our services, but also gain something much more valuable. Our pharmaceutical company customers are choosing us as their commercialization partner to gain more reach and a better efficiency. For our network of retail pharmacy and other healthcare business customers, this means that they gain the broader portfolio of both innovative and the generic and pharmaceutical products at better pricing, which in turn translate into a higher demand for their products, more sticky in consumers, enhance the ARPU and improved margin., For 111, it goes without saying that when our customers do well, we do well. As performance for the retail pharmacies in our network improves, we at 111 see the corresponding increase in product sales, revenues, fees and the customer loyalty. Earlier I provided a preview of good news around strategic partnerships. In this quarter we made excellent progress in expanding the number of strategic partners to over 300, up 100% over the same period last year., Beyond pharmaceutical company, we have developed partnerships with insurance companies, enabling us to further enhance the digital healthcare value chain. In the quarter, we've added another insurance partner, Shanghai Uniondrug. This partnership will give us the power to offer to consumers better access to healthcare and pharmaceutical products at lower prices. In addition, consumers will also gain tools and our supporting services that are personalized to their needs and that emphasize preventative rather than curative care., All these partnerships taken together, allow us to leverage our omni-channel digital platform to better integrate all key stakeholders of the healthcare ecosystem, drug manufacturers, retailers, insurance companies and end consumers. The end result is an ecosystem where stakeholders depend on and benefit from each other, creating a virtuous circle of high med services, sticky customers and a greater profitability for all, including us at 111. And the winner of all this are the end consumers who benefit from enhanced care at lower costs and ultimately better health., Now let's spend a few minutes on our business performance. Our business spun-out by our latest the results. For our B2B segment, the greatest area of strength was the increase of almost 300% in number of orders as well as the revenues from our base of existing customers versus incremental sales from new customers who recently joined the network in the third quarter. Revenue this quarter grew by 134% to RMB2.2 billion and gross profit grew by 344% to RMB58 million., Revenue from existing customers were up 38.9% quarter-over-quarter and newly added customers contributed 12.5% of the growth quarter-over-quarter. For our B2C segment, this quarter saw a slight decline, revenue and gross profit, down by 5.2% and a 6.3% year-over-year to RMB161 million and a RMB32 million, respectively. The decrease here is driven primarily by our decision to focus our efforts on initiatives that will deliver the most value to the Company and our shareholders and these efforts already yielding only encouraging results., We're confident that we will soon be back on the growth track again before -- because we are in a unique position to deliver superior health care to our end consumers at competitive prices One example is our patient management platform, which provides consumers access to the best doctors around the country for outpatient care, regardless of where they live. Combined with our retail pharmacy network, patients can have their prescriptions filled and delivered to them conveniently and efficiently, along with tens of thousands of other health and wellness products available on 111's platform., Against the backdrop of favorable government policies towards digitization, we believe we're in an enviable position to take advantage of the immense health care needs of the country. As we strengthen our infrastructure to help pharmaceutical companies market their products, we're enhancing our smart supply chain and its efficiency, improving our doctor-patient digital platform and providing better care and tools for patients to achieve more favorable health outcomes., Looking towards to the last quarter of the year, we will stay focused on narrowing net loss and furthering what we've done well, increasing sales from our existing base of customers, while gaining new ones, enhancing stickiness and expanding and deepening strategic partnerships. With the recovery of the Chinese economy, we believe that the strategy and execution that have enabled us to build a leading digital healthcare platform in this country will also allow us to take advantage of the immense opportunities presented by the Chinese market., We have proven the power of our ecosystem and we will work tirelessly in the next quarter and beyond to increase its value and to drive growth, continuing the ascend to delivering sustainable and a long-term profitability to our shareholders., With that I will hand the call to Luke to walk through our financial results. Thanks, Luke., Luke Chen, Thank you, Junling. Moving to the financial section on Slide 12, you can see the details of the third quarter 2020 results from Slide 13 to 15 of our presentation. I would like to highlight a few key business and the financial metrics and our focus on year-over-year comparisons, all numbers are in RMB unless otherwise stated. Our total net revenue for the quarter grew 113% to RMB2.36 billion which exceeded top end of our guidance range., Our B2B segment revenue grew 134% to RMB2.2 billion. Revenue contribution from E-Channel, which previously disclosed as a separate segment was now incorporated into B2B segment this quarter. The strong growth in B2B segment was attributed to strong growth from our existing customers as well as the newly added customers in our network., Our B2C segment, revenue was down 5.2% to RMB161 million, mainly due to a restructure of our B2C business as we reduced our investment in third-party platform. Our B2B gross margin was 2.6%, up from 1.4%, while B2C gross margin remained stable around 20%. The improvement in gross margin of our B2B business reflected our ability to continue to improve the margins by maintaining triple-digit top line growth., Overall, our gross profit amount grew by 90% to RMB90 million, and the combined gross margin was 3.8%, compared to 4.3% a year ago, which mainly due to the dilution effect from the rapid expansion of our B2B business with a lower margin. Total operating expenses for the quarter were up 28.2% to RMB212 million., As a percentage of net revenue, total operating expenses for the quarter was down to 9% from 14.9% as we continued to improve our operating leverage and optimize our operating efficiency. Fulfillment expenses as a percentage of net revenue for the quarter was 2.5%, down from 2.8% in the same quarter last year. Sales and the marketing expenses as a percentage of net revenue for the quarter was 4.4%, down from 7.9% in the same quarter of last year., G&A expenses decreased 10.8% compared to the same quarter last year and as a percentage of net revenue for the quarter was 1.2% and down from 2.9% in the same quarter last year. Technology expenses amount increased 49.4% this quarter as compared to same quarter last year, which accounted for 0.9% of net revenue, down from 1.3% in the same quarter last year., As a result non-GAAP net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders for the quarter, narrowed to RMB94 million as compared to RMB110 million in the same quarter last year, which accounted for 4% of net revenue, down from 9.9%., [indiscernible] guidance for the fourth quarter of 2020 on Slide 17. The Company expect total net revenue to be between RMB2.44 billion and RMB2.56 billion, representing a year-over-year growth of approximately 81% to 90%. The above outlook is based on the current market conditions and reflect the Company's current and preliminary estimates of the market and operating conditions, as well as customer demand, which are subject to change., Please refer to Slide 19 to 21 of the appendix section for our selected financial statements, a quick note on our cash position. As of September 30th, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments totaled RMB1.2 billion compared to RMB697 million as of December 31st, 2019. And we achieved positive cash flow from operating activities which amounted to RMB25 million for the quarter. And also we achieved positive cash flows from operating activities for the period year-to-date. This concludes our prepared remarks. Thank you., we are now ready to begin the Q&A session."

Good afternoon, everybody. Thanks for sticking with us. This is Tien-Tsin Huang. I cover the payments, processors and IT services sector at JPMorgan, and really pleased to have with us ADP back at the event. With us from ADP, we have got Danyal Hussain, who many of you know, does a great job at Investor Relations at ADP and always enjoy chatting with Danny he is always super helpful., So what we wanted to do was just go through a list of questions in a fireside chat format if that is alright, Danny, and then we will take some questions from the audience to the extent that we have any. See some already. Just hit the Ask a Question section at the website, and I will do my best to hit those. But again, a lot of these questions. Hopefully, we will address the questions on the top of everyone's minds., So Danny, thanks for being here again., Danyal Hussain, Yes. Thanks for having me, Tien-Tsin. Happy to be here., Tien-Tsin Huang, And it is good to see you. So we will spend about 20, 30 minutes, if that is all right. So let's dig right into the quarter. I know it is not that far away. It was clearly a big upside surprise, both to our expectations, and I would say your expectations as well, given what you guided. You want to call out for us maybe the top two or three areas that drove the outperformance and then what might be sustainable or not?, Danyal Hussain, Yes. Happy to, Tien-Tsin. You are not the only one who, by the way, has told us that we have got a good poker face. So that wasn't by design. We didn't intend to take an exceedingly conservative stance, but in retrospect, obviously, we are very happy with the results., So starting from the top of the P&L and going down, we did see outperformance from a number of categories. Bookings, as everybody knows, is critical to the ADP narrative. And we were more than happy to see that accelerate from the Q4 trough to a 2% growth and a record Q1 level for our ES sales. So that was driven by a number of factors. I'm sure we will get into that in more detail. That contributed a little bit to the revenue upside., But really, the bigger contributor to our revenue upside came from better retention than we had forecasted. I think this is one of the more surprising bits of information to come through in the quarter is that bankruptcies and out-of-business losses, contrary to being elevated in the quarter like we had expected, those were actually down on a year-on-year basis, which in this environment was definitely counterintuitive. So that contributed nicely to our revenue performance., On top of that, something that we don't talk as much about in an ordinary quarter because it is usually fairly quiet is some of our volume-based businesses. So we do things like recruitment, outsourcing. We have a card business. We do wage garnishment payments for our clients., And so all of those together, they can be relatively quick to accelerate or decelerate. And in Q4, we did see a relatively significant decline, not surprising given the freeze in client activity. And that just came back quite a bit faster than we had expected in Q1., So those three factors together contributed to the better revenue. And as we had and coached a lot of the investment community over the past few months, the revenue losses that we were anticipating were expected to come in high decremental margins, because we intended to keep most of the service and implementation organizations intact. And so without much cost offset, those revenues were going to cause a pretty substantial hit to margins., Instead, because the revenues ended up a lot better than we had expected at down only 1%, ultimately, we'd like that flow straight to the bottom line. So margins ended up likewise being much stronger than expected., And on top of that, not just stronger revenue but actually better expense management helped contribute. So Kathleen has led the charge there. She is our CFO, and we kept a very tight line on expenses throughout the organization., We talked about our transformation initiatives and driving a little bit of additional expense benefit in the quarter, above and beyond our expectations starting the year. So that helped a little bit. We managed headcount, I think, pretty effectively in the quarter as well., So if you tie it all together, and we had outsized performance on the top line, some better expense management and all of that driving better earnings growth than we had anticipated., Tien-Tsin Huang, It is good summary. So let's hone in on the bookings piece, right? So that is always an important factor for the stock. That was way better than what anyone had expected, again, poker face aside. How much of that was just adapting to a virtual model versus maybe some pent-up demand or pull-forward perhaps from future quarters as everybody was motivated to sell can you walk us through maybe the top two or three factors that maybe drove the upside from your analysis?, Danyal Hussain, Yes, for sure. I think the short answer is there was probably sum of all of those as a contribution to our outsized performance relative to expectations. We were broadly pleased with the ability for our sales force to go out and sell more effectively in a purely virtual environment., And in the initial weeks, there was an adjustment period. We went through, of course, the process to adequately train and make sure that sales force was as effective as possible in selling in a virtual environment., So you have got training programs that we have for our inside sales force that we were able to parlay into our field sales force. They obviously translated that into an effective piece of momentum in the overall business., Now on top of that, what we saw and what we had expected is that the actual client behavior showed signs of improvement. And so the biggest single factor to the bookings decline in Q4 and the subsequent acceleration is the overall level of activity., So our clients in Q4 were taking, generally speaking, fewer meetings. In many cases, especially if they were in harder-hit industries, for them, it is just not a priority. And so they would put something like an HCM decision off into the future., Fast forward three months, we saw a lot more activity from our clients and prospects. So that was obviously a great sign, and then you compound that with the fact that our sales force has gotten more effective at selling in a virtual environment. And together, that drove a much better outcome than we had anticipated., When you break the results down by business, there were some additional one-off factors that contributed, some of which we might not see persist later into the year but others that we think might., So as examples, we called out our multinational business as having done exceptionally well in the quarter. You just look at the volume of sales that they were able to generate. And yes, there was a little bit of potential of pent up demand in that regard. Some deals that we expected to close in Q4 were pushed into the first quarter, but it is fairly small in magnitude when you compare to the overall U.S. performance., Likewise in the down market, we talked about new business formations as actually contributing in some ways to our down market sales. Along the same vein, we don't expect those higher levels of new business formations to necessarily persist over the coming quarters., But that said, we did see strong momentum elsewhere in the business. And so that fundamental change in how clients are more willing to engage and our sales force's ability to operate in a virtual environment, all of that remains with us as we move forward. And so we are optimistic about the rest of the year., Tien-Tsin Huang, Got it. So hopping on the retention side, Danny. With retention, we have heard through the, let's say, all the peers more or less that, right, less switching in general, which makes sense. People are focused on surviving the pandemic. I want to make a case that with outsourcing, there is a greater need to stick with it because of the complexity, right, and everything else., What else could be driving the retention, I know you moved a lot of your clients to a strategic platform on the low or mid-end, for example. And I would argue that maybe that would drive it, too, irrespective of what's going on with pandemic. But do you feel like these elevated levels of retention are here to stay, could we see it go into another higher level of retention going forward?, Danyal Hussain, Yes. our perspective this is probably a mixed bag. So some of the benefit that we saw in the quarter relates to the non-controllable losses. So whether or not companies went out of business, that is the same rate they went out of business last year., That as I mentioned, that was surprisingly positive. In other words, there was a good source of upside for retention. It is hard to imagine that upside just persisting in perpetuity. So at some point, that will revert back to the mean., But beyond that, the voluntary portion, which is typically most of our losses, that was better, and we think it was for two reasons. We would acknowledge what you described as a naturally high amount of reluctance to switch because you are in the thick of things., There is a lot of complexity, and now it just does not feel like the time if you are running cash rain business for you to switch vendors. And we think we feel the pain and the challenges from that standpoint in the sales process., So it is one of the reasons our productivity is not quite as high as it would be ex-COVID. But the flip side is it seems to be helping the retention. And it is hard to quantify that precisely, but that certainly seems to be one factor., But as you point out, we think what is more important is that our client satisfaction is at all-time highs. And some of that relates to COVID because we were able to stand by our clients and serve them well in this environment., But frankly, this momentum predates COVID, and we were seeing all-time high retention levels in a few of our businesses pre-COVID. We called that out in our second quarter earnings call last year., And so in a world with no COVID, we might have been in a situation where we were still seeing continued momentum and improving retention. That is the part that we are most optimistic about persisting beyond COVID. The rest of it, we would acknowledge there is probably a little bit of noise., For our part, we are trying to take a somewhat conservative approach, at least for the next couple of quarters from the lens of out-of-business losses. So we have factored some of that reverting back to the mean and in fact, even being elevated. If it doesn't play out, that would obviously be a nice source of upside. But at this point, it is too early to call., Tien-Tsin Huang, Good. No, we will keep nagging you about it as you know on this retention stuff, but that does make sense, Danny. So maybe just to round it out, I know you mentioned the margins and the high decremental margin of the business, just like it is very high incremental in good days. I guess we all sort of underestimated that., When you initially guided to the down 300 basis points, you are doing much better than that, 100 to 150 down now expected. I know you are investing, ADP is investing. You are also going through these transformation initiatives and then revenue has gotten better., But talk to us about the visibility that you have now on margins and the priority that you have to preserve margins or to get back to pre-COVID levels. How important is that as we sort of are still fighting through the pandemic, but also you are reinvesting and then you have the transformation initiatives as well. So I guess, again, a broader question on prioritizing margin here?, Danyal Hussain, Yes. I think in many fronts, we are trying to keep a steady hand through all of this. So investments in things like our sales force and things like R&D, those were making a very steady approach to in the downturn., And what that means is it is creating a bit of margin drag if you assume the revenues are in decline. But we are okay with that, and strategically, we believe it is the right thing to do. And we have found a lot of support likewise in our shareholder base with taking that approach., What I think has caused a little bit of confusion is how on the way up, in other words, when revenue is growing, we can have, let's just say, less than 100% incremental margins. But on the way down, we show much more significant decremental margins., And I think the answer to that relates to the time horizon that you are looking at. So as a case in point, if we expected revenues to be under pressure for a period of a couple months or even a couple of quarters, there is really not that much offsetting expense to be taken out for such a short time horizon because the reality is your capacity needs have not really changed that much if you expect things to accelerate back to where they were in a matter of quarters., And in some of our businesses, like the PEO, yes, we have direct offsetting expenses. But for our ES segment, a lot of the direct revenues don't have a one-for-one offsetting expense. In general, we have almost a semi-fixed and semi-variable expense base., So from that vantage point, we didn't think it made a lot of sense to assume that we were going to be able to take cost out. And now we feel vindicated because now the revenue has come in a lot stronger than expected. We let that drop to the bottom line., And now the outcome has been pretty clear that if that is the case, the margins will come in much stronger than we originally anticipated. And the good news, too, is that we didn't take the approach that we need to invest less or invest more in sales headcount., We took this, again, a very steady hand approach, and now we can stick by that. And to the extent that revenues come in stronger or weaker, ultimately, that is what ends up dictating the margin performance for the year., Then above and beyond that, we are driving those transformation initiatives, which are critical to just providing a supplemental amount of margin expansion, clearly showed some progress this quarter by being able to execute on the digital transformation and the procurement initiatives a little bit faster. So we are getting $25 million extra of benefit for that this year. And that is a lever that, obviously, we will keep pushing on as well., Tien-Tsin Huang, Got it. Thanks for going through that. Like I said, sometimes it takes a crisis to learn these things and to [indiscernible] events to sort of expose some of the learnings around the margins, but that does make sense there, Danny. So maybe build on the margin stuff a little bit more. I know you and I have debated this a lot, as ADP modernizes its technology and its platforms and the potential there to improve margin because of retention and everything else., But just that general concept of ADP modernizing platforms, right, where are you in that journey and from a competitive standpoint, what do you think is sort of misunderstood or maybe underappreciated when people think about stacking ADP up against some of the SaaS providers? So a lot in that question, I know. I will let you address it how you want, but sort of a journey to modernization and then where does that put ADP versus some of the, let's call them, the digital-first HCM companies?, A - Danyal Hussain, Yes. It is an important question, too. And the way I would frame it is that Carlos has taken us on this journey to simplify our overall tech stack. And in doing so, that positions you to have a better product because you can concentrate your R&D efforts on, obviously, fewer platform and make them more differentiated. But then you can also optimize your service, your implementation around those fewer platforms, so there is margin and also customer service benefits as well., And so we, at this point, have completed that process for over half of our Employer Services segment revenue. And I'm talking specifically about our down market businesses, where we use RUN and in our mid-market business, where we use Workforce Now., And then what remains now is the up market in the international markets, where we do still have multiple platforms. We feel good about our strategy because we have now proven at least to ourselves and I think also to our shareholders that we can see in this play book the outcome from the down market was a resounding success., The mid-market, we were starting to reap those rewards as well. And so we feel comfortable that next-gen HCM is the platform of choice for the up market. A lot of the technical risk is behind us. And so now really, it is just a matter of chopping the wood and implementing those clients, building the service organization around it., And then where that would put us once we complete that process, which will take time, is that we have far fewer platforms, and the benefits of ADP scale then truly come to light. And now in the down market and mid-market, years after having completed those migrations, that was the gating factor, we think to driving some of the improvements in client satisfaction and the market share gains, especially in the down market that we have seen. So that is obviously what we are looking to replicate in the up market and international., As far as what is, I think, missing from a narrative perspective, I'm not sure that is misunderstood. But what tends to happen is you take any big organization and ADP in particular, we have got this long trailing edge of technology., So we have got super modern technology, our Next Gen HCM, we held nothing back in the development and choice of architecture there. But then we do still have clients on older solutions., And the thing is, from a narrative perspective, depending on your agenda, you can choose to focus on any part of that spectrum. So clearly, we know our competitors will tell their prospects ADP has got legacy technology., But at the same time, you look at the industry analysts, we are focusing on the things that we put forward that is among our more modern stack, and those get rave reviews. The reality is our business is comprised of all of these. And over time, more and more will get migrated over to that more modern stack., I look forward to the day where some of these older platforms are in our past. But the reality is we have happy clients on them, and so we are taking a meticulous approach to that transition., Tien-Tsin Huang, Right, not rushing. That is the ADP way. So given that, Danny, does the outsourcing sort of debate with COVID and PPP and the complexity of everything that is going on in the world, right, I mean, can you make a case that outsourcing could see a little bit more in the way of tailwinds coming out of the pandemic than what will be otherwise observed?, A - Danyal Hussain, I think you could certainly make the case. We know you have made the case, and I think we are trying to make the case to our clients and prospects, too. The piece that gives us evidence that there is something to that narrative is that client satisfaction for those clients is extremely high and has picked up., So our PEO business, we have these HRBPs, business practitioners they hear firsthand about how grateful the clients are that they don't have to deal with all of this complexity in this environment. So we know that kind of the first derivative impact has been more satisfied clients., Second derivative would be you have higher referenceability because those clients are so happy, they refer you or the PEO model, in general, to somebody else that they know. That will take some time, we think very near-term. There are headwinds that right now overcome those tailwinds., But once these headwind abate and once companies feel like they can make decisions the way they would in pre-COVID, that is when we think you would start to really see the benefit of the positioning that we have in that part of the market. So we are optimistic that looking beyond this year, hopefully, the tailwinds with the PEO and other HRO businesses can continue., Tien-Tsin Huang, Okay. That was good to hear. So on the modern side, I did also want to ask you, right, this whole on-demand payroll product or area, seems to be a lot of interest there. A lot of fintechs are doing it right, Danny. So we are getting a lot of questions on that., I know ADP has this paycheck on demand that is out there. So talk to us about what that is and how you can monetize your scale maybe different than some of the other players that are out there and the risk that you would be bearing from that as well., Danyal Hussain, Yes. It is a complex product to put it mildly. But right now, there is a number of different ways that we are going to market to address client needs or demands for on demand., Primarily, we still work with partners in our ADP Marketplace. We have a couple of partners that we worked with for a couple of years, and they provide something called early wage access, which is slightly different from true on-demand pay., You are not actually running a payroll. Instead, what you are doing is providing an advance for the accrued earnings. And there is usually a small nominal fixed fee that they earn on that, and we have different forms of revenue share agreements in those., Long term, there is the potential for more and more companies to start demand true on-demand pay. And it is early to say, but we think the largest of companies are going to be the ones that are most able to handle the associated complexity, the unpredictability of the cash flow needs from an on-demand environment versus a regular payroll, weekly or biweekly environment. And so there is a subset of our clients that we think this is probably a good fit for, and we do have pilot engagements with many of those clients., But what is less clear is for the mid-market or for the small business, is this really going to be the future? Is this something that is provided as table stakes to companies? Or instead, would they be more reliant on something like an early wage access partner?, So unfortunately, the jury is still out on that. I can say that we have got our eggs in multiple baskets. And so we will continue to apply the situation, and we can pivot accordingly. And likewise, the revenue models associated with on-demand pay, that is also something to be determined., But with all that said, the card business is something strategically important. We did make this acquisition of Global Cash Card that we think gives us an edge, certainly from a cost perspective but also from an agility perspective., And so now we do offer a direct-to-consumer and wisely direct offering that gives us a direct relationship with employees even after they leave our clients. So that is an interesting opportunity. And we are still selling Wisely Direct. So pay card program, which is a good way to address, in many cases, the underserved, under banked population of our clients., Tien-Tsin Huang, Yes. No, it is really fascinating. I know we have talked about it, and we have not enough time talking about fintech and Wisely, but it does feel like getting us in a good spot. And I agree, on demand, that could be table stakes. That just could be the way it goes, and there really isn't an opportunity to differentiate or take risk or to monetize., But it sounds like if I replay it back to you, Dan, your view is -- you've got a full spectrum on how you want to serve it, and you want to see how it so how it plays out before you decide on one strategy. Did I hear that correctly?, Danyal Hussain, That is right. And our Chief Strategy Officer, Matt Levin, he is very passionate about this. He spends a lot of time thinking about it. And he's got, I would say, a lot of balls in the air in terms of different ways that we can address this opportunity. And then unfortunately, from your perspective, anyway, it is still not clear which way it is necessarily going to land., Tien-Tsin Huang, Okay. We will put it on the to-watch list. A couple of questions here, Danny, on the question portal around PEO. I think you know we had tried on earlier. I guess the two questions are kind of similar. It is just a question around utilization, COVID rising in the short term, what does it mean for your business and the impacts on your P&L. I think there is a little bit of confusion on the question, but you guys don't take risk, right? t there is occasion on pricing. So how should -- how do you think about where we are in the cycle in PEO?, A - Danyal Hussain, Yes. It is going to be an interesting dynamic for us. So far, there has been very minimal impact to our P&L. As you point out, we don't take any risk on health care, but our carriers obviously do. And so we have carrier partners that will provide their updated repricing to us in the coming months for our renewal period, which takes place at the end of our fiscal year. When that happens, we will have a little bit more insight as to what the level of implied inflation is in that health care., As you know, for years and years, we have had medical inflation well in excess of GDP. Not clear if this is going to drive it to take a step back or whether it is going to be a flat year or whether nothing happens, and we have continued elevated inflation., So not something we don't have insight into today because there is a number of different perspectives. I'm sure that carriers can take on this. You are right. The claims utilization is lower today, but does that mean there is going to be a surge once we get past COVID or are we going to go back to a normal level? Or is it going to remain depressed for possible reasons., That is yes, like I said, that is something that we will hear from our carrier partners. The way you will manifest in our P&L is that next year, so going into our fiscal 2022 year, our PEO revenues will be influenced by whatever level of inflation is built in., And if it is some wild swing, if it is a lot higher than normal or a lot lower than normal, there could be implications for our retention rate in our PEO because that historically has been the case if it is either a high level of inflation or lower. But we will obviously cross that bridge when we get to April and May., Tien-Tsin Huang, Yes. And again, I will ask this, because I know you are not going to give us guidance on PEO growth beyond what you've said already. But from a unit growth standpoint and from a demand standpoint, Danny, any reason to change or why your - the world is different enough that your prior sort of growth targets on PEO wouldn't be applicable anymore, I mean, my gut would be no at least from a unit perspective, but is that something you can comment on?, Danyal Hussain, Not really. I would say the world hasn't changed much except that. We think the value prop has become more compelling. So there still is, regardless of how you determine the TAM of the PEO industry, it is a big opportunity. I know you guys have done a lot of work on that, too., And so that gives us continued optimism that there is plenty of opportunities to sell into the base and sell into the Greenfield market of small businesses. We will keep pressing on that. Hopefully, tailwinds from COVID provide a little bit of a boost. But apart from that, there is no, I think, real reason to think there is any change in the overall outlook., Tien-Tsin Huang, Okay. And I figured that was the case. I know Carlos comes from - I know it is close to home for him. So that is why I wanted to ask, and it is a fun area to study and learn from. So we only have a couple of minutes left, Danny. I know you have been doing other meetings as well. Anything you would call out to us as maybe some underappreciated areas of growth for ADP or other areas where things could be underappreciated in general?, Danyal Hussain, No. I would say there is obviously a ton of moving parts. Hopefully, I think this did come through in our earnings call, we feel very good and certainly a lot better about our positioning in the market today versus three-months ago, not because we were concerned in any way about our relative positioning but just the fact that we are seeing things like retention hold up much better than expected, bookings reaccelerate much faster than expected. So at least from our standpoint, it is a faster recovery than what we otherwise would have expected., We know there is going to be some choppiness in the coming months. But the good news is, even if we see it, we know now how quickly things can kind of snap back to normal. So we are, like I said, feeling pretty good about the current situation., Tien-Tsin Huang, Okay, terrific. We can stop it there, Danny. Thank you for spending the afternoon with us. And again, I know it is a busy time. So, like I said, like I should have said to you earlier, right, have a good Thanksgiving with the family and everything else next week. And I'm sure we will be catching with you really soon. Thanks again for the time., Danyal Hussain, Thank you, Tien-Tsin. Appreciate it., Tien-Tsin Huang, You are welcome., Question-and-Answer Session"

Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining our next fireside chat today with Bausch Health Company. This is on Andrew Newton on for Akash Tewari, and he will be joining us any minute now. And I'm excited to welcome Joe Papa, Chairman and CEO of Bausch with us here today. , So before we get going on our kind of questions, I wanted to turn it over to Joe to make some opening remarks. Please go ahead., Joseph Papa, Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I wanted to just build on some of the comments we made during our third quarter report in November and then just kind of build on that from there. First and foremost, I'd say that our business recovery is in progress. We had a really good fundamental quarter in the third quarter that we reported. I remind everyone that pre-COVID, we had 9 consecutive quarters of organic growth. As we looked at our third quarter of 2020, yes, we were down versus the third quarter a year ago by 3%. However, that was because of COVID. Sequentially though, versus the second quarter, we grew by 28%. Obviously, I'll talk about more of that in the Q&A, but we think that's really exciting that the business recovery is underway. , The other thing I'll talk about is that we are making very good progress on the spin that we announced, the spin of Bausch & Lomb. We believe the fundamental question there is, can we unlock shareholder value by spinning off P&L? And we believe the answer to that is, yes. Although we will explore all opportunities to drive or unlock shareholder value, that's really where we are focused as a management team. , Finally, my comments back to the third quarter is that we continue in the third quarter and through the most recent months of November and October, we are gaining market share with our key products. That's one area of focus for us. We were able to optimize our adjusted SG&A expense during the quarter and manage that so that we could ensure that we had appropriate profitability. , The other comment that we are continuing to focus on is our durable brand. Good news is that around the world, we do business in over 100 countries. We have a global durable brand and a very diversified product portfolio -- final comment I would say is that each one of our business, B&L, also showed sequential growth. It was up 32% versus the second quarter, our Salix business was up 23% versus our second quarter of 2020, and our Ortho Derm business was also up 24%. So you're seeing good recovery in our business that's what makes us excited about the rest of this year and building on our 2021. , That concludes really what I wanted to cover on a brief overview, happy to take any questions at this time., Question-and-Answer Session"

Thank you, Eula, and to everyone for joining our First Half Results Call this morning. I’m pleased to have our Chief Executive, Robert MacLeod, with us on the call today. And without further ado, I will hand over to Robert., Robert MacLeod, Thank you, Martin, and good morning and welcome, everyone, to our first half results presentation. Obviously, given the circumstances, we’re still having to hold this remotely, so I’m very sorry we can’t do this in person. But I do hope you and your families are all keeping well and healthy. Today, I am with Anna and the IR team. And I’m also joined by Karen Hayzen-Smith, who will take over from Anna as our Interim CFO from tomorrow. But as usual, we’ll go through the presentation today and then give you a chance to ask any questions that you may have., As we know, this continues to be a very challenging and uncertain time for all of us. However, across JM, we’re successfully navigating through this difficult period. Although, some of our end markets were initially badly impacted by the pandemic, they’ve recovered more rapidly than we previously anticipated, particularly in the automotive sector, where we’re seeing a strong recovery across all regions but especially China, where we’re now seeing auto production above last year., As a result, in the half, we delivered operating performance ahead of market expectations, albeit significantly below the prior year, and at the same time, very strong cash generation. In both our operating performance and cash generation, I’m pleased that we have outperformed, evidencing that we’ve managed through this period well. Over recent years, we’ve made changes across the business, and these are enabling us to create a more simple, agile and efficient organization. This has given us a strong platform and the flexibility to invest for the future into our strategic growth projects, particularly those which are focused on climate change solutions., In a moment, Anna will talk you through the detail of our performance in the half, but first, I’ll give you my highlights. As I’ve already said, our financial results given the context of changes in our underlying markets are good. During the period, we achieved this while at the same time making significant changes to our group operating model. This will deliver substantial efficiency which will benefit our P&L. And we’re also fundamentally improving the management of our precious metal working capital., We’ve also made good progress with our longer-term growth opportunity. In Battery Materials, customer testing is going well. That and the way that the market continues to develop has given us the confidence to accelerate our plans to scale up in the business. We’re therefore proceeding with the initial engineering work for our second commercial plant. Fuel Cells is going really well, and we’re seeing strong growth and making good progress with customers particularly in China, and our capacity expansion is almost complete. These are just a few examples., We’ll cover the details in these sectors as we go through the presentation today. But let me tell you about what we’ve been doing to set us up for the future. In recent years, we’ve been working hard to structurally improve our business. We’re in a strong position today because of the changes that we have made, and we can summarize them here in three broad buckets., Firstly, we’re executing on our efficiency programs, and I’m happy to report that we’re well on track. These will deliver annualized savings of around £225 million by the end of our fiscal year 2022-2023. Secondly, we’ve maintained our strong balance sheet. This is a really good result, especially so in the current environment. Many of you will recall the unplanned outage we had in our pgm refinery a couple of years ago which put pressure on our working capital, which was further exacerbated by higher metal prices this time last year., Since then, we haven’t just looked to tackle the problem at our refinery, but we’ve taken the opportunity to have a good look at our business and fundamentally improve our metal operating model. This has yielded huge benefit that you see flowing through this set of results. And of course, this drive for efficiency doesn’t stop there. We continue to actively manage our portfolio. And recently, we have divested our activities in water and atmosphere control technologies, which are not core to our growth strategy., So before I hand over, let me summarize. We’ve made good progress in the last six months delivering against our commitments, and we remain in a strong financial position. Because of this, we’re able to invest in our future and strategic growth projects which are hugely important in helping to tackle climate change., And with that, over to you, Anna., Anna Manz, Thanks, Robert. Good morning. Today, I’ll be covering three things: our first half performance; how we’re delivering on our efficiency initiatives; and the significant progress we’ve made on working capital. Starting with our performance in the half. Group sales were materially down, and that was due to COVID. Most of the impact was in Clean Air, where we had customer shutdowns and weaker demand., And as a result, sales were down 27%. Efficient Natural Resources and New Markets were also impacted but less so than Clean Air. And in Health, sales grew. Operating profit declined 42% as a result of those weaker sales, although this was mitigated by a group-wide focus on cost efficiencies, which I’ll come back to a bit later., But first, let me take you through each sector in a bit more detail. Our Clean Air business was most affected by COVID with sales materially down as our customers closed their plant at the start of the pandemic. Our performance has broadly followed vehicle production with our share largely unchanged. And of course, we’ve had the benefit of regulatory uplift particularly in China., As the half year has progressed, we’ve seen a strong recovery in demand. And you can see this in the monthly chart on the right-hand side. This recovery reflects returning consumer demand, the rebuilding of stock in the OEM supply chain as well as short-term incentives in China. So it will be lumpy month-on-month, and I wouldn’t extrapolate the current strength., Operating profit was down 56%, with volume leverage in line with our 75% variable cost base. Internally, we’re making good progress on the initiatives we announced for the full year to simplify how Clean Air operates and I’ll get into more detail on this in a minute. But they do mean that we’re better placed to serve our customers and drive value during this volatility., Looking at the second half, there remains a good deal of uncertainty on both demand and OEM stock levels, and that is showing up as volatility of orders particularly in Europe. Triangulating the external data would currently suggest that if you look at our fiscal year, in Europe and the U.S., light duty production could decline about 20%, with heavy duty declines of around 30%. In Asia, the Chinese market is stronger and is likely to be above the prior year., In Efficient Natural Resources, sales were down 10%. This is because of weaker demand and the usual cyclicality and catalyst demand. Catalyst Technologies serve a wide range of end markets and the impact is varied across them. The biggest impact was in catalyst refills. Here, COVID both reduced demand and delayed orders for our additives business and for our formaldehyde business. In methanol and ammonia, sales were down, but that was as expected after a couple of strong years. This is just the normal phasing of customer change-outs., First fills grew well as the number of new plants came on stream. And licensing was down in the period, but we signed two new licenses. And we have a really strong pipeline of projects that will deliver growth going forward. PGM Services has seen higher and more volatile average metal prices and that’s driven double-digit growth in the half., Operating profit for the sector was down 12% as the weaker demand in Catalyst Technologies and Diagnostic Services were partly offset by the £24 million benefit from higher average metal prices. For the full year, we expect operating performance to be below last year with a stronger second half and similar seasonality. Our Health business saw sales growth in both Innovators and Generics, and that was driven by new supply agreements., In Innovators, Immunomedics is progressing well and has recently received approval. So volumes are increasing in support of the commercial demand. And in Generics, we’re benefiting from multiyear supply agreements in opioid addiction therapies. Operating profit declined 21% as the business mix in the period was weaker. Products in this sector have a wide range of margins, and we were impacted by the cancellation of one of the high-margin innovator projects in the second half of last year when it failed to get FDA approval., In New Markets, sales declined 8%. Fuel Cells saw strong demand and grew 30%, but sales in Battery Systems were impacted by COVID, as well as Medical Device Components, where we saw the delay of elective medical procedures. Operating profit grew to £5 million in the half as we lapped the £8 million impairment of the eLNO demo plant last year. We’ve also seen better sales mix in Life Science Technologies. For the full year, we would expect operating profit to be above last year., Looking further down the P&L. Finance charges were higher in the half. This was due to higher average interest rates across our mix of borrowings and increased interest on our metal borrowings. We’ve made great progress in reducing our precious metal working capital, but there is a lag before we see that benefit come through to finance charges. So the finance costs will remain higher over the full year. At 16%, the underlying tax charge is down year-on-year as we lap the provision last year. And underlying EPS was down materially., In balancing performance against the market backdrop, the Board has approved an interim dividend of £0.20 per share. We expect to return to pre-COVID levels of dividend when circumstances permit and do remain committed to a progressive dividend policy. This is a reconciliation to our reported results. You can see here, we took a £78 million impairment and restructuring charge in the half. And that’s in line with the transformation we announced at the full year. You can see the breakdown of the £78 million in the note at the bottom of the slide. £62 million is the cash restructuring costs, of which £16 million was a cash outflow in the half, and the other £16 million relates to impairments., The next slide will give you an update on our transformation progress. We’ve announced a number of initiatives that together will deliver £225 million by fiscal 2023, and I’m really pleased to say that we are on track. We’ve delivered £140 million so far, with £24 million in the first half. I’m going to good update you now on the work underway., Firstly, procurement. I’m pleased to say we expect to deliver the full £100 million target by the end of this fiscal year. That’s two years earlier than we originally planned, and we’re reinvesting some of this to drive growth. Of course, we’re always looking for further savings in this area, and we’ll update you at the full year. The consolidation of our Clean Air manufacturing footprint will deliver £30 million, with £3 million in the first half. And the simplification of our business will reduce complexity and deliver £50 million, with £8 million in the first half. And we’ve also been working to improve the efficiency of our balance sheet., As you know, metal working capital has been a big area of focus, and we’ve made fundamental changes to our metal operating model to structurally drive down the value of precious metal working capital we have in our business. We’ve done this by focusing on three things. Firstly, we’ve reviewed every aspect of how metal flows through the group, and we’ve optimized it. Secondly, we’re contracting with our customers more effectively., And lastly, we’ve improved throughput at our refineries. We’ve done a great job here, taking out a further £400 million in the half, well ahead of the target we shared with you at the full year results of £300 million for the year. This means at today’s prices, we’ve taken out over £1 billion of volume of metal working capital over the last 2.5 years, and we’re now operating at a structurally lower level of working capital going forward., Moving to the right-hand chart, you can see that in the half, we’ve reduced metal working capital by nearly £300 million. The drivers are the £400 million structural benefit I just talked about plus a further one-off benefit of around £200 million due to the impact of COVID. That is then offset by increased demand, particularly in Clean Air and metal price increases. While we continue to look for further efficiencies, the big structural benefits for this year are largely delivered. So looking forward to the full year, we may see some unwind as a one-off benefit, and we will see working capital movements following development. I’m really proud of what we’ve achieved and the momentum that we have, driving simplification and efficiency across the group., We’ve maintained a strong balance sheet and have access to £1.8 billion of liquidity. Our net debt at the 30th of September with £878 million, down from the £1.1 billion at the full year. Net debt to EBITDA is 1.6 times, and that is comfortably within our range of 1.5 to 2. This is a strong performance given the impact of COVID on our earnings., As a result of the strong working capital performance, we saw a free cash inflow of £256 million in the half, improving from the £382 million outflow for last year. I’ve taken you through how we’re thinking about the performance of our sectors over the second half. And given the uncertainty, I won’t be giving quantitative guidance for the year. However, we currently expect a materially stronger second half compared to the first half., Efficiency savings will be about £60 million in the year, and we continue to invest in our strategic projects that are critical for our future growth and efficiency. This includes the commercialization of our eLNO material in Battery Materials, the investment in the efficiency and resilience of our refineries within Efficient Natural Resources and the completion of our new Clean Air plants. We expect to spend up to £400 million in the year., With that, I’ll pass back to Robert., Robert MacLeod, Thank you, Anna. So you’ve seen our performance in the half, so let me now talk about our future growth opportunities, starting, first of all, with our more established businesses. In Clean Air, we continue to benefit from tighter legislation especially in Asia, and this growth remains intact despite the dislocation caused by COVID. Asia is our next leg of growth, and we’re already seeing the benefit coming through particularly in China as new legislation comes in across light and heavy duty. This gives us a significant value uplift per vehicle., Our new plants in Poland and China are now rapidly scaling up. And these will support our growth but will also allow us to drive further efficiency across the sector. As we said before, these should be the last of our big investments in Clean Air. And therefore, going forward, Clean Air will have strong cash generation., Now to Efficient Natural Resources. Here, we are targeting the highest growth segments. We want to be an enabler of the energy transition, which includes our hydrogen technologies and the move to low-carbon chemical processes. In the last six months, our new license wins demonstrate the effectiveness of our technology and provide a good leading indicator for future catalyst growth., In addition, the opportunity for our pgm recycling business continues to be attractive given its low cost and carbon footprint compared with primary sources. The investments that we’re making in our refineries will enhance this as well as enabling us to drive further metal efficiency. And in Health, we secured a number of supply contracts across both Generics and Innovators. This is already starting to deliver results, and we’ve also launched two more products from our pipeline., We’ve been talking about our new facilities in Poland and China for some time, and I’m delighted that we have them and that both are now ramping up. Poland came online first, shortly followed by China, and India will follow next year. We will soon have a truly global, highly efficient manufacturing footprint focused on five near-identical world-class plants in the U.S., North Macedonia, Poland, China and India when it’s complete., We announced in June that we’re starting to consolidate our older capacity, and we’ve been gradually moving production into these newer facilities, starting with our large volume products. And as well as optimizing our footprint, we’ve also been transforming our business work, moving from one that’s locally focused to one that’s much more. This isn’t just about how we manage our manufacturing assets but also how we are managing, for example, our customer relationships, our technical, quality and supply chain teams. And together, this is making a huge difference., Now looking at the world around us, there’s no doubt that action around climate change has increased. But importantly, this remains true today despite all the uncertainty that we’re seeing with COVID. The move to net zero is accelerating. And with this, we will all see significant change. We’re ready for it and already have solutions from battery materials to fuel cells and also technologies for hydrogen production. In these areas, we have competitive advantage. So let me take you through each of these, starting with battery materials., The battery materials market opportunity is very significant. The market we are targeting, the automotive market for high energy cathode materials, is expected to be around 1.7 million tonnes by 2030. And as we bring our business to scale, we’re making progress across a number of key areas. Firstly, we’re continuing to develop our technologies as we are seeing considerable interest in our customized products. Secondly, I’m very pleased with how testing is going. We’re making good progress not only adding new customers to our pipeline but also continuing to move existing ones through our development funnel., In the first half, two nonautomotive customers moved into cell prototyping. This is a more advanced stage within full cell testing, where we are working together on their specific cell format. This is a really positive development because we’ve now moved beyond the standard testing stage and are working more closely on their specific application., The other thing to point out here is the time to market is usually faster for nonautomotive applications, the advantage being that we’ll be getting valuable learnings ahead of auto customers moving into this phase. This type of testing and customization is supported by our application center. We know that our ability to customize is something that is really valued, and we recently opened our second application center in the UK for more advanced cell testing work., But of course, having a great product in the lab is not enough. We have to be able to manufacture at scale, and that’s where our commercial plants come in. Our first commercial plant in Poland is progressing well, and we have now completed filing, so very soon, you’ll see the building going up. And the picture on the right here is a CAD drawing of what the plant will look like. The build is on track. And as a reminder, it will start production in 2022, and we will have commercial automotive production in 2024., Over recent months, we’ve continued to engage with customers particularly those in the more advanced stages of testing. That deeper engagement has given us greater understanding of their requirements. And this has meant that we’ve had to evolve the design of this first plant to ensure that we have the right flexibility to manufacture their products. But at the same time, we don’t want to compromise on speed to market, and hence, the cost of this plant has increased. We therefore now expect that the full cost of commercialization of eLNO to be around £550 million compared with around £350 million previously., But it’s important to remember that this is our total cost of commercialization, so that includes everything from the pilot plant to the commercial plant, but also the application centers, research and development and, of course, management costs. As I explained a minute ago, this is a really exciting and significant opportunity. With the way the market is evolving and our increased confidence from customer testing, we are accelerating our scale-up plans and start in engineering design for our second commercial plant, which will have 30,000 tonnes of capacity., We expect that this plant will have a substantially lower capital intensity towards a level that is similar to other European battery materials plants as we take our learnings forward. And this will enable us to deliver a return on invested capital at scale at the upper end of the industry range of 10% to 15%, reflecting the good performance in customization of our eLNO materials. Finally, all of this has to be done in a sustainable way. So as part of our commitment to our customers and the Global Battery Alliance, we are sourcing renewable energy from plant start-up., Moving on now to hydrogen. Hopefully, many of you were able to join the hydrogen seminar that we hosted back in September. On that call, we went through a lot of detail. So today, I wanted to give you the highlights and summarize why hydrogen is going to be a very significant opportunity for JM. Hydrogen is recognized to be part of the climate change solution as it plays a key role in the decarbonization of many applications that are otherwise hard to decarbonize across transport and industry., As many of you know, we’ve been a leader in hydrogen for many years, and our strong position across both hydrogen-powered fuel cells and the production of clean hydrogen is underpinned by years of science expertise from across the group. Today, the hydrogen opportunity is already taking shape, so now let me take you through these areas in turn., Our Fuel Cells business continues to grow strongly, with sales up 30% at the half. And to remind you, we manufacture key components within the fuel cell stack, the catalyst coated membrane or, for some customers, the membrane electrode assembly. The performance of these are absolutely critical to the performance of the fuel cell stack but also the cost of the overall system, too. Today, we’re seeing lots of activity and demand in the market particularly in China, where the government has recently announced a new policy to encourage the development of the fuel cell value chain in various cities, which includes supply chain subsidies. And we’ve been investing to meet that demand., Our new capacity in China is now complete, and our UK capacity expansion will be online by the end of this fiscal year. And we’re already planning our next phases of expansion including a new fuel cell catalyst plant. On the customer front, we’re already working with many of the leading fuel cell players in China as well as major European and American truck and auto OEMs. We have several joint development agreements in place which will see growth in our business as these platforms are launched. And of course, on the technology side, we’re continuing to make good advancements particularly on improving membrane durability, a key performance metric for OEMs, which will also help on the cost-down road map. And to help our efforts here, we’ve added to our headcount on both the technology and manufacturing side., So let’s now move to hydrogen production. In blue hydrogen, being the production of hydrogen with carbon capture and storage, we have leading technology. I’ve talked before about our involvement with a couple of high-profile blue hydrogen projects here in the UK, HyNet and Acorn. These are coming along nicely. And in fact, we’re already working on the second phase of HyNet. We also have a strong pipeline of opportunities in Europe, North America and Asia at various stages of development, which we’ll keep you updated on. These new opportunities are several times larger than the initial HyNet and Acorn projects., In green hydrogen, being the electrolysis of water using renewable energy, our focus is at the proton exchange membrane, or PEM. This is a nascent market which is only really starting to develop now. However, it is clear that it plays to our strengths given our expertise in fuel cells and strong competitive advantage in platinum group metal catalysis. We are significantly increasing our efforts here. And we’re already currently testing with leading electrolyzer players and have significant manufacturing capacity, which is ready to deliver products for megawatts of PEM electrolyzers., So to wrap up. We saw a strong recovery in performance through the half, and we successfully navigated what has been a challenging period, outperforming in terms of both operating and cash flow performance. In recent years, there’s been a huge amount of work going on behind teams to create an organization that’s more simple, agile and efficient. And it’s because of these changes that we’re in a stronger position today. But importantly, there are further benefits to come still. The drivers of our more established businesses remain intact despite the impact of COVID. And looking to the future, the impact of climate change is real. And in tackling this, the world is going to see significant change. We already have technologies across battery materials and our hydrogen solutions to enable this change, and we look forward to playing our part., So that concludes our presentation, so thank you for your time and listening this morning. Now with that, we’ll pause. I’m very happy to take any questions., Question-and-Answer Session"
23854,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4390486-investec-group-ivtjf-q2-2021-results-earnings-call-transcript,"Fani Titi - Joint CEO and Director, Nishlan Samujh - CFO","John Storey - JP Morgan Chase & Co , Fani Titi, Ladies and gentlemen, good morning, and welcome to our financial year '21 Interim Results presentation. I'm joined by Nishlan Samujh, our Finance Director, on the stage. Before we review the results for the period, I would like to give you a brief update on our COVID-19 response. I'm going to start with an update on our people. , In South Africa, we are beginning to return to the office in the UK, given the second lockdown, staff continue to work from home. Clearly, the future world of work post COVID-19 will benefit from the multiple remote working models now available to us. However, for Investec, we want to protect our culture. , Therefore, the office will remain the center of gravity as we go forward. We continue to support our colleagues through a number of wellness programs as we go forward. Moving on to our clients. Current COVID-19 relief provided to 60, 6.3% of gross loans in the UK and at peak, that number was 13.7%. , In South Africa, the current proportion of the loan book under relief is 2.2% at peak, that number was 23%. So we're beginning to see some good recovery in both geographies. We also facilitated over ZAR 20 million in donations on behalf of our clients, primarily using income generated from our Private Clients Charitable Trust. In the UK and SA, we are an accredited lender for government schemes. Moving on to our communities. , As we had announced before, we committed GBP 3.6 million of relief, approximately ZAR 78 million, for relief for communities, and about 2/3 of that amount has been allocated to date. We also did indicate earlier that senior leaders and staff donated via salary deductions to community initiatives that were primarily focused on food security, economic continuity, health care, education and programs that support anti-gender based violence, particularly in South Africa. , Moving on to operational resilience. Managing the integrity of our balance sheet has been very primary in this period. So we have conservative levels of capital and liquidity. Firstly, to weather the crisis, second to supply our clients and thirdly, to fund growth in the long term. We have made further investments in IT infrastructure with the aim of supporting our working from home mode of work, but also to continue to enable our staff to support our clients in giving them the kind of client experience that they expect from Investec. , Clearly, where our staff has gone back to work, we have instituted a number of safety protocols. Now looking at an overview of the results. It is clear that the trading environment has been very, very, very difficult, where we have seen, in effect, massive economic contractions. And we also have seen very volatile markets. , Despite these conditions, our client franchises performed particularly well. We saw a net inflows of £336 million in our wealth businesses, with funds under management increasing 15%, by 15% to €51.1 billion. In the Specialist Banking businesses, we saw good client acquisition in both geographies. Our net core loans grew by 1% to £25.2 billion with strong loan growth in our Private Banking business in the UK and that growth being offset by subdued corporate lending activity, as corporates, we're positioned quite conservatively in a period of crisis, and that happened in both geographies, and we also saw corporate repayments., Our client engagement has continued to be quite good during this period as we have used our digital platforms to continue to support our clients. As indicated, our balance sheet is very strong with robust capital and liquidity levels. Our loan book has been particularly resilient. The quality of our loan book, obviously, is an indication of this, the quality of our clients and the strength of our business model. , The loan book is conservatively provided, and Nishlan will later unpack our provisioning. The credit loss ratio increased from 23 basis points to 47 basis points, driven largely by macroeconomic assumptions in our models as we calculate our ECLs using IFRS 9, but Nishlan will go into that. This level of provisioning is a little lower than we had during the last half of financial year 2020, and we expect to see our CLR moderating as we go forward. , We have also seen good cost discipline with cost well-managed, costs down by 14% during this period compared to last year, 8.1% down in neutral currency. We continue to to see good execution on our strategic plan. Our plan remains clear and unchanged, and execution will remain key as we go forward. And later on in the presentation, we will indicate progress made on our strategic plans. Just going back to looking at, Nishlan, you are confusing me. , Okay. Starting off, just looking at the operating environment, I have already indicated that we saw a very sharp GDP contractions. You can see in South Africa, our base case assumption is for a 9.2% contraction in GDP for the calendar year 2020. The impact of this contraction is obviously going to drive ECLs higher as we input assumptions in our models. Second, activity levels will be low. That will impact noninterest revenues, but also the value of assets in contracting economies will be lower. , In the UK, our base case assumption is for a 10.1% contraction in GDP. We also saw very volatile markets. On the chart, you will see that we have had the FTSE in the comparative period at about 7,000. And in the current period that we're reporting on at about 6,000. So you will expect that to impact the revenues in our wealth business in the UK as an example. We also will see asset valuations being down given that level of volatility in the public markets, and that will flow through also into the private markets. , Looking at the second graph, we do see there the level of volatility in the average rate of the rand versus pound sterling. Over the period, the average rand against pound sterling depreciated by 20.6% compared to the prior period. So in our results, you will see the impact of that level of depreciation. Just going to the next slide. Despite this level of volatility and the contraction that we have seen in the economies in which we operate, we are beginning to see some pickup in activity. And to evidence that we have given you on this slide some numbers from our Private Banking businesses. , Starting off with South Africa and looking at Private Bank lending turnover with March, 2020 as a base. You can see the impact of the lockdown in April, May and June. And as, excuse me, as the lockdown started to ease off, in July, you can see turnover pickup quite significantly. Then in September, we saw turnover quite impressively up, albeit it we were still not where we were in March. , If you look at point-of-sale transactions, as measured by the value of cut transactions, again with March as a base, you can see that by September, we have caught up to where we were in March. So encouraging levels of activity. And these will hopefully continue depending, of course, on whether the lockdowns remain, where we are there is no stricter lockdown in South Africa. , In the UK, if you look at the graph on the left, we're looking at a high net worth mortgage monthly lending turnover. And the light blue bar is 2019, and the darker blue is 2020. Again, you can see activity in the months of May and June being rather subdued, and you can see a pickup. If you look at client acquisition in the UK Private Bank, you can see that in April, May, we saw reductions in client acquisition, but we have seen that pickup since. So we are hopeful that we will continue to see activity improving, and that will inform our view of our outlook of performance in the second half. , Just looking at results, highlight for continuing operations. Adjusted operating profit decreased by 48.4% to GBP142.5 million. Again, the main contributors, as indicated in the economic environment and market volatility will be the compression of net interest margin, the reduction in noninterest revenue, given lower activity and trading income reducing by about 100% giving, given some hedging losses in the UK bank, related to our structured product, and Nishlan will cover that later on. This was offset, obviously by good cost control, as I have indicated. I also have indicated that our impairments were up in the area. , All in all, that led to adjusted operating profit reducing by 48.4%. That translated into adjusted earnings per share coming in at 11.2%, which is 50% behind the prior period, but ahead of the guidance that we had given. Net asset value per share increased quite pleasingly at an annualized 9.3% since March. Our return on equity is reported at 5.3% versus 10.7% in the comparative period. Our cost-to-income ratio increased from 67% to 72%, largely driven by a reduction of 24% in net income that offset, of course, by the cost reduction of 14% that I have referred to., The credit loss ratio increased from 23 bps to 47 bps, as I have already covered. I'm pleased to announce that we have declared an interim dividend of 5.5p, which is compared to 11p in the comparative period, but I hasten to add that in the comparative period, the results included 80% attributable earnings from Ninety One. We obviously do endorse the guidance notes that have been issued by the sub with respect to banks having to conserve capital and having to support the real economy., We did not pay a dividend, a final dividend when we announced our results in May. And the current dividend that has been declared is predominantly carried by our capital-light businesses. As we continue to retain a 25% shareholding in Ninety One, and we have 2 wealth businesses that have performed particularly well in this tough environment. So within our banking businesses, while there is a contribution to the payment of dividend, we have substantially built up capital resources in this period., If we look at the performance of the franchises, very briefly, and Nishlan will go into more detail. So I'm going to be quite high level. Starting off with the South African business, the Specialist Banking business. So adjusted operating profit reduced by £52 million. Again, the biggest contributors were compression in net interest margin given the sharply lower interest rates, a reduction in net noninterest income, given lower activity and lower investment income. And obviously, we spoke about increased impairments and good cost control, reducing the extent of reduction., In rands, that reduction is 23%, which is quite a commendable performance in the current environment. Our wealth business in South Africa saw profit in rands increasing by 2.3%, and we saw net inflows in discretionary funds under management. Our group investments, where we have our holding of Ninety One, our investment in IEP, IAFP, IPF. We saw a reduction of €29 million, and Nishlan will go into more detail there. So all in all, the South African business recorded a reduction in profit of 45.6%, but in rands, the reduction is 34.3%. , As I indicated, there was a 20.6% depreciation of the average rand versus the sterling pound. The ROE for South African business in total came in at 8.1% versus 13.5% in the prior period. Moving on to the business in the UK. The Specialist Banking business recorded a reduction of GBP67 million or 84%. , Again, the drivers in the banking business were the same. Net interest margin compression, noninterest revenue reduction, increase in impairments and significant cost savings within that business. And in this business, as I have mentioned a little earlier, we saw a hedging loss of GBP53 million. So of the reduction of GBP67 million, GBP53 million has been contributed by the hedging loss, and Nishlan will cover that a little later in the presentation. Our wealth business performed particularly well, as I indicated, the level of the FTSE in this period was about 1,000 points lower. , We saw significant cost reductions as well despite the fact that we had to spend some cost in certain restructure activities that we performed. So a pleasing performance, even though that performance is behind last year's performance by 5.2%. Group investments relates to our holding in Ninety One. , I'm going to hand over the presentation to Nishlan and to go deeper into the detail. , Nishlan Samujh, Thanks, Fani, and good morning to everyone. It's really a pleasure to deliver these half year results to you. I'm going to dig a little deeper and just pick up from where Fani left off. I think, again, if we look at the overall business, from a geographic perspective, our operating income, around about 60% of our operating income was contributed from our UK business. And from an operating profit perspective, around about 70% of the operating profit was contributed from our South African business. , From a divisional performance perspective, our Wealth & Investment business contributed 26% to the overall operating income with the Specialist Bank contributing 74%. And from a profitability perspective, you see around about 8% contributed from group investments. That includes the return on the 25% that we hold in Ninety One and other investments that we have chosen to represent separately from our Specialist Banking businesses so that you actually can evaluate the franchises independent of these group investments that we hold. The Wealth & Investment business contributing similar to operating income at 26% and the Specialist Bank at 66%. Now let's get a little deeper into the franchise businesses, and let's start with the Specialist Banking business in South Africa. , Looking at some of the core drivers. Net core loans and advances did decrease by 1.6% in the period to ZAR284.4 billion, and that was mainly driven by the fact that our private client book remained relatively flat, and I will give you some detail later on when I decomposed the loan book. But we did see that Corporate South Africa in the main remained fairly defensive from a balance sheet perspective and also fairly cautious from an investment deployment perspective, given the economic outlook. And therefore, we did see a reduction in our levels of corporate activity over this period., In particular, one of our business lines, Investec for Business, which deals with trade finance and import solutions did see lower activity levels given the uncertain outlook, and again, corporates being cautious on the deployment of working capital, given the uncertain outlook caused by the COVID environment. Customer deposits remained strong, at a reduction of 2.8% to ZAR365 billion in the period is really part and parcel of our overall liquidity management. From an operating income perspective, overall operating income decreased from ZAR6.3 billion for the half year to ZAR5.8 billion in this half year. There was quite an even impact across various line items. And if I unpack that., Net interest margin did contract, I think more than we would expect at about 41 basis points in this period. When we look at it from an overall year perspective, we would expect that in the second half that this will recover by at least half, if not more, of that reduction in basis points. And that is a function of the fact that our assets have repriced earlier than liabilities and the nature of the sharp decrease in interest rates in the market, particularly over the period January to March. And if we compare to prior year, there's been an overall 300 basis point reduction in interest rates., There is an impact that will linger and lower interest rates does result in a lower contribution on our effective endowment capital that we hold, and the fact that we continue to hold a defensive cash position on our balance sheet. From an activity level perspective, lending and transactional fee income was impacted by the sharp slowdown that you saw on Fani's slides, particularly between April and June. And in fact, as we saw the economy opened up, in September, we saw activity levels above the prior year. , So I think there will remain volatility as we see activity levels impacted by cautiousness around economic activity. And, but I think the resilience of our client base is starting to reflect as the economy is much more active. From an investment income perspective, within the franchise businesses, the investment assets within these, within the pillar did generate lower dividend flow income in the period as well as lower opportunities for realizations. And therefore, we have seen lower investment income. Now we did have positive momentum in terms of markets because there has been a recovery since the end of March. So some of our listed stocks did contribute positively. But we remain, we have continued to adjust down some of the valuations related to our non-listed portfolios. , From a cost-to-income ratio perspective, the overall cost-to-income ratio for the Specialist Bank in South Africa was 55.4%. That is a bit weaker from where we have operated historically, and that's notwithstanding the fact that costs have reduced by 6% in the period. And that included a reduction in variable as well as discretionary spend in the period. You will see in both South Africa and the UK, headcount has been quite conservatively managed throughout this period as we ensure the strength of the overall business. From an operating income perspective, a reduction of 8.7% as I had unpacked that. , Turning to our Banking business in the UK, from a net core loans and advances perspective, we saw an increase of just under 1% for the period, so annualized at closer to 2%, growing to GBP12 billion, and that was mainly experienced within our high net worth mortgage book, which continued to experience higher growth levels as we continue to expand that particular base. , Similar to South Africa, we saw lower overall corporate lending activity. Customer deposits in our banking business in the UK grew by 2.4% in the period to GBP15.6 billion. Unpacking operating income, and again, very similar effects that we saw across our banking businesses. Net interest income did decline by 2.1% over the period with NIM net interest margin reducing by about 25 basis points since September 2019. , That reduction, I think, mainly driven by lower interest earned, again, on our balance sheet position. And similar to South Africa, we are experiencing an improvement as repricing of liabilities takes effect as well as repricing for credit risk. From a cost-to-income ratio perspective, overall cost-to-income ratio did reduce in the current period. And that's within the context of having reduced operating costs by 12%, which is mainly driven by a combination of variable remuneration and discretionary costs. , And again, we will unpack. That with operating income reduced by 21.1% overall cost-to-income ratio for the period was at 80.7%. From a Wealth & Investment perspective, again, let's focus on the drivers and turning to our South African business. I think we were quite pleased in the period where with net inflows into our discretionary platform of ZAR 3 billion and positive markets, mainly driving the increase of funds under management by 16.2%, up to ZAR 293 billion. We did see outflows in our nondiscretionary funds, but that's really off the back of clients managing their portfolios. , Adjusted operating profit for the period increased by 2.3% to ZAR 264 million, and that was supported by strong demand for our offshore offering, which does yield foreign currency earnings as well as increased brokerage activity, particularly in the early stages of the period. Higher average annuity and discretionary from as well as cost management continued to contribute. We did experience lower interest rates, and that has a somewhat a negative impact., From an operating margin perspective, the operating margin improved from 32.3% to 32.8%, with operating income up 1% against operating costs increasing by 0.4%. Our Wealth & Investments business in the UK, here again, with positive market momentum. We saw funds under management increase by 13.3% to £37.6 billion, and we did experience net inflows over the period of £315 million into the portfolio., From an operating profit perspective, we did see a reduction of 5.2% to £28.9 million. And that was notwithstanding the fact that we did have higher funds under management. But as Fani had alluded, there were lower market fundamentals affecting the level of fees earned in the period. Brokerage was strong in the period, particularly on our nondiscretionary funds as clients continue to manage their underlying portfolios., Lower interest rates does have a negative impact, and that has been absorbed effectively into the base, given the current interest rate outlook. From a cost perspective, costs were well-managed in the period, but there were increases in regulatory costs, particularly the FSCS levies that we contributed. From an operating margin perspective, a slight decline from 18.8% to 18.6%, really influenced by a slightly higher reduction in operating income at 4.4% compared to a reduction in operating costs of 4.3%. This is a new pillar, which is group investments., And given our holding in Nighty One, we felt that it is appropriate to reflect these assets, which at the end of the day, are assets that the group has generated through various historical activities and platforms. And the main pool of assets in these, which we have separated from our franchise Specialist Banking business is our investment in Nighty One. Our investment in IEP in South Africa, our investment in the Investec Property Fund and our investment in the Investec Australia Property Fund., The Investec Property Fund delivered its results yesterday. And what you see in this slide, it's really an unpacked of every income statement line that is influenced by the fact that we consolidate some of these investments and that there's a large portion attributable to minorities. So for example, the Investec Property Fund, we hold 24% interest in the fund and recognize the impact on the left-hand side of this graph on 100% basis and then allocate the portion attributable to minorities in non-controlling interest., So the large negative valuations is driven by the fact that the funds have reduced the carrying value of, in, of their property investments, as is experienced in these kind of, in these markets. And lower valuations and lower equity accounted income from IEP, which is really a function of the lockdowns that you saw, which would have affected activity within the portfolio itself. , A large portion of the reduction is effectively reduced out of this, out of the numbers through our noncontrolling interest. In this period, we equity accounted about GBP18 million of income from Nighty One, who released their results two days ago. And we anticipate, not anticipate, but we will receive a dividend of about GBP14 million on about the 23rd of December from that particular investment. The rest of the portfolio effectively accounting for the net reduction from GBP30 million contribution last year to GBP13 million in the current period. , Now if we look at revenue, and this is really bringing the picture back to the combined group. Overall operating income decreased from GBP959 million to GBP729 million. Net interest income, net fees and commissions, really driven by the fundamentals that we have spoken through. Investment and associate income driven by what have unpacked in our group investments portfolio and trading income driven by what Fani had mentioned, was a GBP53 million effectively loss recognized in the period, and thus a reduction in trading income of just over 100% in the current period. And that is associated with our financial products business in the UK and effectively our structured deposit business. , And in this current period, what we have done is effectively stopped the, any new business associated with some of the high-risk profile in that particular book. The heightened cost of GBP53 million includes costs incurred in the current period to reduce risk in the portfolio and to exit certain elements of the portfolio. This is still effectively a deposit taking and a successful business overall, and we continue to incur risk management costs navigating the current market. , We are guiding to the fact that in the second half, we will continue to see heightened costs experienced, and that's really off the back of continuing to execute derisking of the underlying portfolio, which places us in a much better position as we enter into '21, into the '22 financial year and the '23 financial year. From an operating income perspective, you see the mix with annuity income increasing to 81.1% as the level of deal income in this type of environment has had a lower weighting on our overall revenue. , From an earnings driver perspective, again, a summary of what was presented from the divisions, our third-party funds under management increased from GBP45 billion, up 15.5% in the period to GBP52 billion or 14.6% on a neutral currency perspective. That was on the basis of net inflows of GBP336 million in the portfolio and driven by recovery of markets that we have seen since the end of March. Core loans and advances increased by 1% to 30, sorry, to GBP25.2 billion, and that is a reduction of 0.4% in neutral currency, with strong performance within our Private Banking business, particularly on the, in the UK platform. Customer accounts up 1%. If we unpack some of our loans, and firstly, I'll start with the South African loan book. Here, we saw flattish performance within our mortgage and high net worth lending books. That includes turnover as well as new activity in the period. Our property lending has well relatively muted on the early part of this particular period. But the negative movements on the portfolio, again, been driven by corporate lending., Now we did see strong growth within our corporate and acquisition finance portfolios and a reduction in other portfolios as corporates repaid and manage their balance sheet liability positions as well as lower activity levels. Unpacking the UK net core loans and advances, you see strong growth in our private client lending activity of 11% in the period as well as high net worth and specialized lending of 16% in the period. This has been a core strategic area of focus for the group, and we are pleased with the level of growth achieved. There was positive momentum also achieved with some of the regulatory initiatives in the UK, in particularly around stamp duty relief., The corporate activity in London or in our UK business and other jurisdictions remaining relatively steady in the period, but with no real growth experienced. Coming back to the income statement. Our cost-to-income ratio has weakened from 67% to 72% in the period. And as Fani had highlighted, that's driven by the fact that in neutral currency, revenue was down 17.8%, with operating costs reducing by 8%. Operating income was influenced by lower net interest margin and valuations, offset by a continued activity levels within our underlying franchise portfolios., From a cost perspective, the main areas in which we experienced reductions in costs related to personnel, where we had fixed personnel costs reducing by 6.2% in the period as well as marketing costs, and that reduction really driven by us, the activations in the COVID-19 period reducing. And we did eliminate certain sponsorship arrangements and obviously, a tighter focus on overall allocation of resources., Now looking at impairments. I think impairments, it's important to note that we did report at the end of March 2020. We were already effectively in a COVID environment at that point in time. And we did see a marked increase in impairments as we reported. With overall impairments increasing from about £31 million in the first half of last year to £102 million in the second half. In this period, we continue to increase our impairment levels with the overall impairment charge at £66 million. And that, as Fani has highlighted, is mainly driven by the update to our macroeconomic scenario., So having applied scenarios that we generated off the back of the March results now into the September results. The reduction in the macroeconomic environment, I think, really driven within the first half of this financial year. There has been an increase in some of our stage 3 provisioning as we have continued to ensure that we're well covered, taking into consideration collateral. For the past 12 months, we have raised impairments or created impairment charges to the income statement of around about GBP168 million. , Looking at it by geography and a South African perspective, our net credit loss ratio closed at 35 basis points for this period, significantly up from 18 basis points and ahead of our sort of long term experience, but significantly lower than what we had experienced in the second half of last year, where our credit loss ratio was 55 basis points. From an overall charge again in South Africa, cumulative charge over the last 12 months of about ZAR 1.4 billion, with impairments charge for this period of GBP573 million, markedly up from last year, September, but below our second half experience. And that's a consistent experience as we move on to our results in our UK and other geography. , Here, our credit loss ratio was at about 60 basis points compared to 97 basis points in the second half of last year and 28 basis points in the first half. From an overall group perspective, we guide towards a credit loss ratio of between 30 to 40 basis points through the cycle. And with the group credit loss ratio at about 47 basis points, we remain elevated. , From a balance sheet provisioning perspective, on the left-hand side of this slide, we detail our PLC or our UK and other geography, and on the right-hand side, our Southern African businesses or Investec limited. Balance sheet provisioning, again, providing you a mix between our stage 1, stage 2 and stage 3 portfolios, seen an increase in our stage 2 provisioning, as we did migrate a larger portion of our book into stage 2, and I'll unpack that in the next slide. , And overall, impairments really driven by migration between portfolios and particular write-offs that would have taken place in the current period. Our overall coverage ratio for stage 1 at 30 basis points, stage 2 at 3.4% is down from our coverage ratio of 5.4% in the prior year. Now here, we increased our Stage 2 portfolio from about GBP576 million to around about GBP1.3 billion. And the migration into stage 2 was really driven from our forward-looking macroeconomic scenarios rather than any observed credit deterioration or credit quality deterioration. , The portfolio that we would have been migrated to stage 2 based on credit quality continue to maintain a higher level of coverage. And given the lower probability of default on the portfolio that has migrated into that particular staging, we saw a reduction, a net reduction in overall coverage ratios. Stage 3 is really a function of the specific assets in that portfolio. And in the current period, we would have had some write-offs for assets that were more fully provided and closure on those particular transactions. , And therefore, or closure on our views, and therefore, a slight reduction in our stage 3 provision. From an Investec Limited perspective, we continue to see an increase in overall balance sheet provisioning with our coverage on stage 1 increasing 2.5%, stage 2, relatively stable at 2.4% and stage 3 at 33.3%, again, is a function of a mixture of the assets and write-offs experienced in the current period. This slide effectively details the migration that we saw between Stage 1 and 2 in PLC and in South Africa. So overall, our Stage 2 portfolio at 11.5% compared to 5.1% in the prior year. And in South Africa, at 6.4% compared to 5.3%., Again, the majority of the staging is really driven by modeling factors that we have brought in. Migrations between stage 2 and stage 3 are really specific to exposures, and we haven't seen any specific trending either within areas that we may be concerned at from a COVID perspective and the overall portfolio. Now trying to bring the picture to a close a couple more slides. ROE on this slide, we unpack it for you between the various businesses. The Specialist Bank in South Africa generating an ROE of 9.1% in the period. And utilizing around about 39.2% of the capital base of the group., With the Specialist Bank in the UK, generating a 0.7% ROE with a credible performance from the underlying portfolio offset by the reduction in trading income arising from the £53 million loss that I'd mentioned earlier. Our overall, Wealth & Investment businesses continue to generate significantly to the underlying ROE of the business. These businesses, their capital requirements are really driven by their operating income. So the higher your operating income, there are, higher your capital requirements. And in the UK, we did have an acquisition historically that has goodwill associated with it. Group investments in the UK that's solely the return from Ninety One., And in South Africa, it's the return from Ninety One and a positive contribution from our Investec Australia Property Fund, offset by negative movements given the valuation adjustments coming through in this particular period. So overall, ROE coming in at 8.1% for South Africa and 2.8% from a UK perspective. And I think it's very important that these ROEs are contextualized within the environment that we are operating in. And what we've seen from across the sector. From a return on tangible equity, the material difference in this ROE is really represented in our wealth businesses, which includes a higher level of intangibles., From a balance sheet perspective, overall capital ratios remaining robust in both South Africa and the UK. I think it's important to note that we report on a standardized basis in the UK and on the FIRB basis in South Africa. In South Africa, we continue on the journey to AIRB. We have received model approval on several models to migrate to AIRB, and we're currently on a parallel run process for implementation successfully in January. But there is one material portfolio where we are still in discussions in terms of the overall modeling approach with the SA. Our, we continue to quantify that the differential to AIRB is around about 2% positive uplift on capital. From a liquidity perspective, loans and advances to customers as a percentage of custom deposits was at about 76.4%. And we've continued to manage and maintain high levels of readily available, highly liquid assets, with overall cash and near cash at GBP12.9 billion. , Now having presented the current results, and we haven't really done this in the past, but we have introduced a slide, which gives you a view of our expectations to the year-end. I think it's in the context of it is a forecast and take it as such. Overall, we anticipate that client activity will continue to recover, and we've seen that in the months past September, and we expect that trend to continue. , Net interest margin, as I've indicated, is also expected to improve, notwithstanding the low interest rate environment for factors that I've highlighted. Noninterest income is expected to improve relative to the first half. But overall, we still expect double-digit and, we say early double-digit decline for the full year, given negative movements on investment income. , With regard to trading income, we expect it to continue to be markedly lower, driven by the fact that we will continue to manage down risk in our structured products book and that we anticipate if markets remain as they are to continue to incur the same level of cost, risk management costs that we incurred in the first half. From an expected ECL perspective, we expect to see continued moderation and cost from an overall full year perspective is expected to decrease in the mid- to upper single-digit in overall. , So bringing all of this together, we expect to be ahead of the first half in the second half of this financial year. Fani, I now hand back to you to be... , Fani Titi, Nishlan, thank you for that comprehensive unpacking of the results. I would now like to cover sustainability. We look at sustainability as an integral part of our business. That's why we continue to integrate it into business strategy. , As we always say at Investec, we live in society and not off it. So this is quite an important part of who we are and what we do, but also, we do see significant business opportunity in sustainability. So we talk of creating a financial and social value by living in a sustainable way, ensuring a low-carbon and inclusive world. Our framework is based, as I said, on living sustainably in our operations. We also partner with our clients on their ESG journeys, and we offer sustainability products and services. , I did earlier on indicate when I talked about how we have reacted to COVID, how we have partnered with our clients to distribute certain aid to communities. We also align our community initiatives and corporate social investment to our SDG priorities. If you look at our priority areas, SDG 10 being reducing inequality in SDG 13 being climate action are our core priorities. And secondary priorities include clean water and sanitation, affordable and clean energy, industry innovation and infrastructure and a few others. And in our corporate banking business, a number of opportunities have risen out of some of these areas of work., Our advocacy and thought leadership is based on our active participation in the United Nations Global investors for sustainable development, the UN GISD. We also work with industry in the UK and South Africa to ensure policy coherence around sustainability. Also as there is a transition towards a more sustainable world and planet, but also in the transition around global warming. We also use the strength of our brand to educate and promote sustainability thinking. Just looking at what we have been able to achieve in the period under review, we published our first stand-alone TCFD report, the Task Force and Climate-related Financial Disclosures., We also tabled some resolutions at our AGM in August, where we received overwhelming support from our shareholders, 99.95%. We also committed to net zero during this period and purchased carbon credits to achieve same. We were ranked at number 55 out of 5,500 corporates in the Wall Street General top 100 most sustainable companies and 9th in the social category. In South Africa, we are rated level one in terms of the financial services code. And as I indicated, we have launched a number of ESG-related product, including in the UK. So to conclude the presentation, I would like to take a bit of stock as to where we are., Clearly, we have concentrated on protecting our resilient balance sheet have kept high levels of capital, and we are lowly leveraged, and we have high levels of liquidity to continue to navigate a crisis of our lifetime. And to continue in that vein to support our clients and to be prepared to fund future growth. That remains our position, and our confidence has been demonstrated in the fact that we have declared a dividend in this period and our expectation of the second half is for a much improved performance. We believe the business is well positioned for the long term. Over the last 18 months or so, we have engaged on a program of simplification. You will remember that we did exit a subscale wealth operation in Ireland., We did close Click & Invest, the Robo adviser in our wealth business because we did not believe we would get through the kind of scale that we required. We exited the Hong Kong investment portfolio because the risk to our inappropriate as far as we were concerned. So we have continued to simplify our business. We now are substantially complete, sorry, we will be substantially complete in terms of our simplification process by the end of the current financial year. We announced this week, the conclusion of the sale of Investec Australia Property Fund Management company with proceeds of about AUD 40 million. We also have completed a JV partnership in India with the largest bank in India to strengthen our position there. , And we have announced earlier during this period, closer integration of business enabling functions in the UK and as announced earlier, unregrettably, we will have about 210 of our colleagues being made redundant as a consequence of that. If you look at what we have been able to achieve in terms of cost discipline because that is what we have control over in this period of crisis, we have made significant strides in terms of cost discipline. , In the UK Specialist Bank, fixed costs have been reduced by GBP40 million since we presented to the market during February '19, during our Capital Markets Day. The changes that Ruth and her team have announced will obviously impact future costs. So we do expect cost to decline in the medium-term within that business. Group costs, we expect to reduce to under GBP35 million at the end of fiscal year 2020. , Again, a 24% reduction to the level that we saw at the Capital Markets Day presentation. We also have had a strong focus on growth. We indicated in reporting on these numbers of the progress we have made in a high net worth mortgage lending book in the UK and that we are on track to reach the 6,500 clients that we needed to reach to breakeven. , And from there, we will continue to grow clients and to have that platform move into profitability. We have also launched in South Africa, an online business banking business, business banking platform, rather. And we expect over time to do well out of that platform. Our Investec Life proposition has gained traction. So as we look forward, we will have a strong focus on growing those selected initiatives that we have chosen to invest in. , While we will be quite disciplined on cost, we will continue to invest for the future. We had also talked about capital optimization and the rightsizing of our direct investment portfolio in line with our stated strategy. In South Africa, over this period, we have seen that portfolio reduced by GBP1.1 billion. Clearly, in these markets, it is difficult to rightsize that portfolio because we are not in the business of throwing away valuable assets, we will not sell for the sake of selling. So the progress has been much slower than we would have anticipated given the environment. , So we think the fundamentals of our business are particularly strong, and we're confident that our business is well positioned for the long term. And we have deep and well-established relationships with our clients, and we continue to foster our client-centric entrepreneurial culture, where our people live for our clients, as we say, colloquially, we do break China for our clients. We remain committed to great client experience demonstrated by our agility and increasing intensity of client engagement in a time of need. We will continue to execute on our strategic plan. While our medium-term targets are under review, given the effects of the pandemic on the economies in which we operate and the markets that we operate in. We are, however, making significant progress to advance our strategic objectives, positioning the business for the long term., We are now ready to take questions. Thank you., Fani Titi, I think we will start with Audio Africa. And then thereafter, go to questions that have been e-mailed to us., Question-and-Answer Session"

Some technical issues switching over from GM through their feed before. I'm very pleased. I'll dive right into have with us Kumar Galhotra, President of Americas IMG. He is responsible for the P&L of the Americas [indiscernible] International along with a newly established commercial vehicle business unit for the U.S. and Canada. He reports directly to CEO, Jim Farley. And has a track record, including VP for Product Development, APAC; VP Engineering; VP Lincoln; and Chief Marketing Officer and President, North America., I am going to turn it over to Kumar, who has I think a couple of slides and then we have a whole bunch of questions., Kumar Galhotra, Thanks a lot, Brian, and thanks for having us. Today, I am going to give a quick update on our launches, how they are going in North America since we have a very important launch here, and also focus on the opportunity for growth in our commercial vehicle business. We are creating a Ford that grows profitably, it generates free cash flow, and it's all led by our automotive business. And we are going to grow in the right areas. We will expand our leading commercial vehicle business. So we already provide great vehicles for our customers, but we are also going to offer holistic ecosystem of digital productivity solutions, solutions that actually drive loyalty and recurring revenue streams for us., We are going to lead in the electrification where we have strengths and scale, for example, the all-electric version of the Transit, the F-150, and the Mustang. The F-150 BEV, that's coming in 2022, will be a true work truck, and we are also growing by incubating scaling and integrating new businesses some of which will of course be enabled by Argo AI’s world-class self-driving system. We are allocating capital, resources and talent to our strongest businesses and to developing must-have products, must-have products like the Bronco., Dave Seider was a fireman for 34 years. He recently retired. Sent us a lovely letter. For years he operate that Bronco you see on the right, it's a 1977 Bronco, a fire truck known as Brush 2. He said it was chosen for its size, wheelbase, cargo capacity and great off-road capabilities. The Bronco was finally retired in October of 2019. That Bronco you see there served for 42 years. So we are bringing the same enthusiasm and commitment to our new products as we did 42 years ago for that Bronco. New products like our 2021 F-150, the Bronco Sport, and the all new all-electric Mustang Mach-E., So throughout 2020 even during the industry-wide shutdown, we – that happened because of COVID, we prepared for the high-quality launches of all these products. In fact, we use the unanticipated downtime to continue to validate launch preparations, and in case of F-150, a very methodical sell down of our current model. I am delighted to say all the launches are in great shape, all new F-150s are rolling off the line in Dearborn and production has started in Kansas City. We've also started building Mustang Mach-Es and Bronco Sport earlier this week., Over the years, we've launched many, many generations of F-Series. We know what the launch ramp-up curve should look like. We are taking very appropriate conservative approach. We know that every truck must be released with exceptional quality and we are doing everything in our power to make sure that that happens., We are accelerating the use of connected-vehicle technology and data for early diagnosis and resolution for our launch issues. I'll share a couple of examples, and Mach-E engineer was able to remotely diagnose a low-voltage battery issue, isolate the root cause to a specific fuse, recommend the repair and he did all this without ever physically accessing the vehicle., Similarly, during the F-150 launch, the power running boards were having an issue on one of our prototypes. Again, the engineer was able to pull all that data remotely, replicate the failure and identified and fixed without ever touching the vehicle. These types of technologies obviously help both in speed and quality of execution for our launches. And happy to say all the launches are in good shape., I am going to now share some things about our commercial vehicles. We are the commercial vehicle leader in the U.S. We have 45% market share of Class 1 through 7. We are building our strengths to expand our commercial vehicle business by introducing electric versions, our F-150 and the Transit., On top of that, we will add a suite of software services that drive loyalty and recurring revenues. The two largest addressable profit pools in commercial vehicle are electric commercial vans and the pickup. We estimate the global van battery electric industry will grow to 1.1 million units by 2030. That is a compounded annual growth rate of over 50%., We own work. These electric vehicles will be true work vehicles, extremely capable with unique digital services, over-the-air capabilities. They will improve the productivity and uptime for our commercial customers. We are also North America’s commercial truck and van leader. The transition of fleet vehicles to zero emissions especially for the fast-growing last-mile delivery is critical to achieve our carbon neutrality goal by 2050. We are ready to lead this charge starting with the all-electric Transit, all-electric F-150. It’s good for the planet and it's good for our customers., Our electrification strategy plays to our strengths, pickups, vans, performance vehicles, utilities, segments where we are strong, segments where merchants are good. The all-electric F-150 coming in 2022 is a perfect example of this strategy. Our F-Series vehicles have been best-selling vehicles for 42 years and all-electric F-150 will be a great addition to that portfolio., We know these customers very, very well. We listen to them. We observe how they use their vehicles. For example, we observed that many of them bring a generator to their work site to power their tools. The generator is generally large and noisy, so we designed the powertrain for both – the vehicle that we are about to launch, the hybrid-electric F-150 and, of course, the battery electric that's coming to allow our customers to power their tools directly from the truck., Let's talk about vans. We revealed the all-electric Ford E-Transit last week. It meets or exceeds the needs of our commercial customers, maximizes productivity and uptime, and reduces cost of ownership. We are going to offer a range of configurations that get the job done. Cargo van, chassis cab, cutaways will offer three roof heights and lengths in North America., One of the really important things for fleets is because a lot of them do upfits, to be able to move their upfits from their ICE-Transit to the E-Transit, they'll be able to do so seamlessly because we've kept the same interior box. We also have access to a lot of telematics data for these customers, so we analyzed 45 million miles of data to understand their daily routes. And we designed the E-Transit to suite these needs while delivering a total cost of ownership that’s much lower., E-Transit has a targeted estimated range of about 126 miles in the U.S. and 368 kilometers in Europe. This is very tailored for those plan groups that I talked about earlier. It will be highly connected 4G LTE embedded modem, connected embedded navigation, our SYNC 4 system. You can pre-condition the vehicle while it's still plugged in, gets over-the-air updates, 12-inch touchscreen and access to – this is really important access to Ford Commercial Solutions., And besides doing all that, it also has great physical space, improved cab access, wider walkthrough capability, uncompromised cargo capacity. So all that work is done by putting the customer at the center. We are always putting our customer at the center. We deliver choice, convenience, value for our customers through services that actually improve their productivity., Our engagement with our customers goes beyond the initial point of sale and last throughout the ownership cycle. And these long-term partnerships allow us to gain the insights that we need to design better products, services, experiences, which ultimately deliver more value for our customers., To Ford, the value is returned both directly through subscriptions and indirectly through loyalty and better performing vehicles. We can provide real-time data and insights to the fleet manager about their vehicle. We can provide them data on geo-location, vehicle health, driver behavior, connected data and insights from the vehicle that help those customers with two coordinates. First is the safety and productivity of their employees and second is improved uptime and low cost of ownership., Connectivity also allows it to curate daily experiences for our customers, creates value for them, builds customer engagement and loyalty. We want our customers in our ecosystem where we offer services across the total ownership cycle. This is especially true for commercial vehicles where our connected services become integral part of their businesses, helping them get the work done with great uptime, improved efficiency, fleet management, improved traditional revenue opportunities for us, revenue opportunities throughout the ownership cycle., So the value of our ecosystem goes far beyond the vehicle itself. It includes over 600 commercial vehicle center dealers, more than 2,000 EV certified dealers. All of these ecosystem parts keep our customers moving and productive. This transformation comes down to leveraging our greatest strengths. The trust and scale we've built with these fleet customers worldwide, we are taking our commercial vehicle business to the next level aided by decades of relationship with hundreds of outfitters and thousands of dealers. Most importantly, we are entering the services business in a very meaningful way, launching loyalty building services that our customers will love and can't live without., Brian, that is the end of my presentation, and I would love to take some questions., Question-and-Answer Session"

Very pleased to get what many would consider the keynote of our Barclays Conference. We're very pleased to have with us the GM team: Mary Barra, GM Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Doug Parks, GM Executive Vice President of Global Product Development Purchasing and Supply Chain; and Travis Hester, who had been in Customer Experience, Canada before that but has just been appointed the GM Chief EV Officer., I think we'll hear more about that during the presentation. So with that over to you, Mary., Mary Barra, Well, thank you for the introductions, Brian. We really appreciate all of you joining us today. Three years ago at this conference, I laid out our bold plans to create a profitable all-electric future, aligned with our vision of a world with zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion., I said that our zero emissions future would build on the groundbreaking Chevrolet Bolt EV, the industry's first affordable long-range EV and this would -- future would comprise of a portfolio of desirable, obtainable and profitable EVs underpinned by an all-new global platform delivering at least 300 miles of range and powered by batteries that provide greater range at a lower cost, and supported by a robust open-standard EV charging ecosystem to encourage consumer confidence and mass adoption. And then we quietly went back to work., Within months, we accelerated our ongoing business transformation so we could redeploy resources and move faster toward our transition to EVs and AVs. We reorganized our global product development organization. We optimized or redeployed capacity. We secured critical partnerships to improve efficiencies and scale. And we focused on hiring the right talent to win in EVs. Today we have 20,000 software and electrical engineers with plans to add more., In retrospect some of you may have thought we were being a bit too quiet about all the hard work going on behind the scenes. So in March at a special EV Day, we opened the doors of our state-of-the-art GM Design Dome here in Warren, Michigan to give you an in-depth look at our LTM platform and a peek at some of the all-new EVs in the works, including the GM Hummer EV and the Cadillac LYRIQ., Just two weeks later, when the pandemic shut down much of our North American operations, we heard whispers that we might have to delay or scale back our EV initiatives. We didn't. In fact, it was never on the table. We resolved as a leadership team to move even faster to accelerate the transition to EVs. Since then you've watched us do everything it takes to capitalize on the enormous EV market opportunity ahead., We are leveraging our iconic brands, technological innovations, design engineering, and manufacturing expertise and our scale in a way that is changing how customers and investors view our company. This is how we will win. And it's why Doug, Travis and I are so excited to be with you today., The all-electric future we are building at General Motors, integrates all things we do best so we can put everyone in an EV, generate profitable growth and create shareholder value. We are pivoting to a growth strategy and a zero emissions future from a position of strength. To drive and guide our profitability moving forward, our growth strategy is a 360-degree view of the business designed around delivering world-class customer interactions. This strategy is the context for every business choice we make as we move forward., It is a compass for where we are going and it supports the pursuit of our vision. It encompasses product leadership in EVs and AVs and continued dominance in pickup trucks and SUVs; licensing and monetizing our proprietary platforms and developing new software and services; leveraging our scale and our manufacturing capabilities; building a diverse equitable and inclusive team; and holding a steadfast commitment to good citizenship through sustainable operations and a leading health and safety culture., Today we want to focus on how General Motors will profitably grow by delivering a very broad EV portfolio that will drive consumer adoption and create shareholder value faster than many people think. We'll do this with beautifully designed EVs across brands and price points, technology development that improves range and lowers cost, and an exceptional customer experience with services our customers expect and that create new revenue streams., EVs are core to creating GM shareholder value. The drivers behind our profitable ICE business translate to EVs and will help us build on our momentum and grow profitably. These include improving speed to market with a dedicated EV organization that I'll talk about in a few minutes; iconic brands and industry-leading customer loyalty; product development, design and manufacturing expertise including our network of safety labs, proving grounds and other test facilities., A distributed network that ranks at the top of sales and service satisfaction studies year-after-year-after-year; and our global scale to spur mass EV adoption. We've developed these assets and capabilities over decades. They are real competitive strengths that start-ups will struggle to match. , As I just hinted, we are announcing today that we are creating a dedicated EV organization called EV Growth Operations. It combines the start-up agility with the strength of the General Motors team. Leading this team is Travis Hester as Brian just shared our new Chief EV Officer. The team will be entirely focused on the EV business and driving mass consumer adoption. He will be empowered to minimize complexity and make decisions fast. , Travis will report to Mark Reuss, GM President and also with to Steve Carlisle, our GMNA President. He has spent the past year working to elevate every customer interaction and experience to world-class levels through our entire purchase and ownership process. As President of GM Canada, he created the largest automotive software engineering workforce in the country and expanded its innovation network through partnerships with universities, start-ups and business incubators. , With this team in place and as technology continues to evolve and become more affordable, combined with our size, our scale and our skills we will be poised to lead in EVs and importantly to do it profitably. And I want to note that we're not simply reorganizing our teams. This is part of a broader cultural transformation to position our company to lead in the future of mobility. And I can tell you that team is excited and committed. , Along with our dedicated EV organization, our integrated strategy is a competitive advantage for GM. Given our scale, we'll realize $2 billion in cost efficiencies alone in shared engineering, manufacturing, marketing and corporate cost. Then add our iconic brands, industry-leading customer loyalty and established sales and service network. Also 100 years of experience at vehicle validation, safety, testing manufacturing and design. , You can see our design approach in the beautifully crafted vehicles like the GMC HUMMER EV and the Cadillac LYRIQ. LYRIQ scored the highest of any vehicle ever tested in our vehicle confirmation clinics. It was the highest-rated in interior and exterior appeal among all vehicles luxury and non-luxury. And then there's the heart of our new EVs, our proprietary flexible Ultium platform. But the real value we bring isn't just one aspect of the business alone. It's how we bring it all together for our customers. , Let me share one compelling example. Up to 80% of ICE vehicle costs that don't involve propulsion are also shared on EVs. It's another reason why we believe developing EVs is core to growing our business and creating values for shareholders. Our work to accelerate our EV and technology leadership is a significant undertaking. But we know, we control everything it takes to lead and to win. , We will invest an additional $7 billion in EVs through 2025 bringing our total investment in EV and AV to over $27 billion. Included in this figure are the vehicle and propulsion investments we need to earn market share leadership in EVs in North America. It also includes additional EV assembly capacity and battery capacity on top of what we've already announced so far: Factory ZERO in Detroit; Spring Hill assembly in Tennessee; and our Ultium Cells JV in Lordstown, Ohio, which by the way is ahead of schedule. , We began hiring more than 1100 new employees at the battery manufacturing facility just a few weeks ago. This additional investment means our CapEx will exceed our normal annual run rate of $7 billion through at least 2023. It also means we will spend more on EVs and AVs than on gasoline and diesel-powered development. In all, 60% of our product development team resources will be dedicated to EVs and AVs. To help drive growth and further widen our competitive advantage, we announced that we will hire 3,000 new employees across engineering, design and IT through the first quarter of next year to help us reinvent the future of product development and Software as a Service in our EVs. And we are funding all of these investments with internally generated cash flow., The first pillar of our capital allocation framework is to reinvest in the business and we are doing this to drive growth. We will strengthen Ultium's competitive advantage, support best-in-class EV manufacturing and create compelling EVs that will improve our market position and generate growth. For example, in the U.S., just increasing our share in the top 10 BEV states to match what we achieve in the rest of the country would add two percentage points of market share growth representing 2,800 -- 280,000 units., As we focus on growth and on accelerating a zero emissions future, we are always open to partnerships that have the potential to improve scale and to validate and monetize our investments. This year, we expanded our long-time relationship with Honda with two important initiatives. We will jointly develop two EVs for Honda using the Ultium platform. And we also agreed to explore codeveloping a range of vehicles and cooperating and purchasing R&D and connected services., We expect others will be interested in licensing our Ultium technology as automakers and other industries meet increasingly higher market demand for clean power. So now, you know we're all in on investing to establish leadership in EVs. We're committed to fighting for EV market share until we are number one in North America, achieving margins similar to or higher than our ICE business and exceeding our previous target of selling one million vehicles globally by mid-decade., So let's talk about the vehicles that will get us there. The GMC HUMMER EV, which we unveiled last month, combines the best of everything GM has to offer. It will be the first off of our Ultium platform. We know truck buyers. And we use these insights to create a super truck, a category-defining flagship EV that's priced competitively with premium trucks and SUVs in the market today. HUMMER EV customers will benefit from innovations like Super Cruise; OnStar; and our vehicle intelligent platform digital architecture that enables all of it; as well as four-wheel independent air suspension; MultiPro Tailgate; and other design and engineering features that distinguish our trucks., The HUMMER EV has everything you would expect from a super truck bearing the HUMMER name. It has cool and capable functionality like CrabWalk, Extract Mode and Watts to Freedom. Its modular Ultium battery platform supports multiple configuration at price points competitive with high-end trucks and SUVs in the market today. Customer reservations have greatly exceeded our expectations and we look forward to delivering them next fall., Another great thing about the HUMMER EV is what the development team was able to accomplish in a compressed amount of time. Inside the company, we talk about the need to work at ventilator speed, referring to how we joined with Ventec Life Systems to launch ventilator production in just 30 days from our first meeting. Earlier this month on the earnings call, I noted that the HUMMER EV team remarkably cut development time in half by working fast and by leveraging virtual engineering and the simplicity and flexibility of the Ultium system. It's the product development equivalent of ventilator speed and you will see more of it., Based on what we learned during our HUMMER EV development process, we expect to cut development time of our future EVs by nearly 50%. So as a result, we expect that the Cadillac LYRIQ will arrive in the first half of 2022 approximately nine months earlier than we originally said. In addition, we are pulling a total of 12 EV models forward. We're revamping and resetting the entire portfolio plan and moving fast, especially in our higher-volume plays, some of which are moving forward as much as 40 months., In the U.S. by the end of 2025, approximately 40% of our entries will be BEVs. We plan to launch 30 new EV models globally by 2025 and two-thirds will be available in the U.S. Cadillac, GMC, Chevrolet and Buick will all be represented with EVs at price points for families, for work, for adventure and for performance., We are also preparing a comprehensive EV fleet strategy to make even deeper inroads with commercial customers. And we'll have more to say about that early next year. Now Doug will dive deeper into our EV propulsion leadership and what it means for improving range and reducing battery costs to industry-leading levels., We intend to be the industry benchmark. And Doug's team is already testing second-generation Ultium Technology with very encouraging results. When Doug is finished he'll turn the presentation over to Travis, who will announce our Ultifi platform. It re-imagines the customer experience, as part of our all-out pursuit of global EV leadership., And then, I'll wrap-up and hand things back over to Brian., Doug Parks, Thanks Mary, and thanks to Barclays for your opportunity to talk with you today. Like Mary said, we have a great story to share on EVs. And fortunately, it's a story I never get tired of telling., The short version is, if you compare us to the competition in the EV space, we believe we have more flexibility, more versatility, more scale, and more experience than anyone else. And we're putting together a full portfolio of electric vehicles in a variety of styles and price points, more cost effectively than anyone else. So let me explain how., The Ultium platform is the foundation of our EV strategy to drive units, power electronics and battery pack. We developed it as the foundation of our EV architecture, minimizing part count and maximizing flexibility. And it sets a new standard for configuring a common set of components, in many different ways., Our propulsion systems can be tailored to accommodate almost all individual vehicle needs. The drive unit family Ultium Drive consists of five drive units, containing at least one of three different motors that enable front-wheel drive, rear-wheel drive, e-assist all-wheel drive and ultra high-performance all-wheel drive, from anything from a compact vehicle to the 1,000-horsepower GMC HUMMER EV behind me., For batteries, a super-efficient common cell is the key to all this. We will use one, super-efficient common cell for all applications. That's why we're designing and making our own large-scale high-energy cells that will be the basis of our entire electric line-up. Inside this cell will be our latest most-efficient NCMA chemistry, with the ability to iterate and improve as the technology develops., We design our packs to use the smallest number of the largest cells possible. Because they're rectangular, our cells stack efficiently into modules with less wasted space between cells than modules with other form factors. And with fewer electrical interconnects and a simplified cooling system. This will yield battery options that will have from 50 to 200 kilowatt hours, enabling ranges as high as 450 miles., These cells can be stacked horizontally or vertically into modules, depending on vehicle profile needs. This flexibility enables both, pouch and prismatic cells to optimize our global footprint and increase our cell options. Using this approach we can serve different customers in different markets, in different segments while also helping to future-proof the energy storage system., That's because when new technology and chemistry become available, we can change the cell while preserving the overall battery architecture. This flexibility will enable us to build EVs in every segment from performance vehicles to family haulers, to work trucks. And we don't have to reengineer specific components from battery packs, to the wireless battery monitoring system within them, every time we bring a new vehicle to market. This will speed development time. And it will reduce complexity and thus material costs., None, Horizontal stacking enables low-slung performance vehicles that are part of our DNA as a company and seen on the left. And in the middle, we show an image of what we use for those vehicles in between like, midsize and compact crossovers which are also very popular here and in other global markets., We can make single stacks of six, eight, 10 or 12 modules for popular crossovers or we can double-stack as many as 24 modules for the power and capability needs of large trucks and SUVs. And as I said the beauty of this is that, we're doing all of this, using one common cell. And this shows exactly what we mean when we talk about how scale can give us an incredible advantage. Let's say, for example, you put 24 of these cells in a module, you put 10 modules in a vehicle and you sell one million vehicles. That's 240 million of the exact same cell in that scale., This scale will also allow us to leverage the benefits of our strong purchasing, high-scale manufacturing and supply chain capabilities while minimizing and spreading engineering investment in capital., And it's a big part of what will get us to the leadership position in cost and performance. We'll leverage this technology together with our other manufacturing might to bring EVs to market quickly, with quality, strong capital efficiency and low material cost. That's how you win., We've talked a lot about the cost curve. At the risk of repeating myself, I'll say it again. It begins with a common cell. That gives us scale, because we're making the same cell in huge quantities that improves quality too. And it gives us the agility to work in every vehicle segment. If the market shifts, we don't need to retool cell plans., And finally, it enables continuous innovation. Our manufacturing approach also affects the cost curve. It's a complex and developing manufacturing process and having a strong joint venture like we do with LG is the way to win., Manufacturing and joint ventures allow us to excel in operating equipment efficiency, first-time quality and waste recycling. And combined with LG, we've already leveraged this experience by creating virtual simulations of build and actually reducing build equipment and costs., Another benefit is value chain optimization. We will combine GM and LG Chem supply chain leverage to create a best of both worlds advantage for supply costs. In addition to all that, to really move the needle on EV costs, we must focus on battery chemistry and hitting breakthroughs that will increase energy density while reducing material cost., We see high potential in silicon and lithium-metal anodes, chemistries that will improve vehicle range and affordability even beyond the gains our customers will see from our first Ultium-based EVs., By the time, we get to the next generation of Ultium, which we're already working on, likely by mid-decade, we'll see a 60% cost improvement versus the Bolt EV, for example, while getting twice the energy density., This is big stuff. For this and many other reasons, we expect to be on the leading edge of performance and cost compared to anyone and everyone else in the EV space. For our next-generation Ultium chemistry that I referred to, GM R&D will lead the way., We have already created prototypes of our next-gen chemistry that are more than halfway through durability testing. We created these new cells at our R&D Cell Fabrication Lab that opened in 2015. And yes, we have that capability in-house., As some of you may know, we also have North America's largest battery test and validation lab, again, in-house. And we've begun construction on a new production cell and manufacturing process lab to allow us to continually improve our cell design and manufacturing capability., The bottom line is we are developing deep, battery technical and process expertise. We are pouring that expertise into our Ultium EV platform. And we believe we are on the battery cost frontier today and we intend to set the pace for the future., A proof point of our commitment to lead is the $27 billion, Mary talked about that, we will spend between 2020 and 2025, including investments to drive battery cost and performance leadership. That's a significant investment and we expect significant results. And we expect to see those results quickly., For many of our Ultium EVs, we are shortening the product development cycle by as much as 50%, as Mary mentioned. The foundation of this accelerated development is the Ultium platform. Our shortened EV development time is also a result of how quickly we develop the HUMMER EV and what we learn while doing so. Key enablers here are empowered EV teams that are co-located and challenged to go fast., This includes a culture focused only on what makes the product better, more profitable or faster to market a culture that says, it's okay to take calculated risk on the path of success, a culture that knows a winning product is the only thing that matters. A proof point of this culture is our recent zero parts late unprecedented for us to our first production build phase of the new HUMMER EV., Other key enablers include early alignment on a single-styling theme, as you can see, that's pretty easy to do; heavy systems modeling, simulation and validation; eliminating the prototype hardware phase; and direct release of math to production tools cutting over one year off typical hardware iteration., We're also applying the learnings of our recent strong launch success, including T1 trucks and SUVs into our EV launches., With these highly empowered teams in place and thousands of new hires on the way and with technology continuing to evolve and become more affordable and with our size and our scale and our skills and our commitment we will lead EVs and we will do so profitably., Another key enabler for our new platforms is, our new Vehicle Intelligent Platform or VIP the innovative digital electric architecture that will underpin nearly every GM vehicle globally by 2023. VIP will greatly enhance the customer experience that's at the center of our strategy and our universe. And you'll hear more about that here from Travis soon., It's capable of over-the-air software updates not only for upgrades, but also to add features. It was developed leveraging all the experience and intelligence we've gained from a quarter century of OnStar. With future feature upgrades and subscriptions to various services, VIP supports monetization of Software as a Service. And of course it will be 5G-capable in the future and already leading cybersecurity using protective features in the hardware and software., And finally, we will continually involve our VIP software architecture to enable improved digital services across all customer interfaces that include mobile, cloud, edge and all-in vehicle functions. By 2023 it will be on 29 of our models including all of our T1 trucks and SUVs and it's absolutely a game changer., Speaking of monetizing our advanced technology, we can and we'll do that with yet another game changer that's Super Cruise which continues to delight our customers and pile up accolades from the press and public alike. It's a recognized industry leader for its performance and its ability to keep the driver safely engaged., It was recently featured in Consumer Reports and what they said about it is, a great credit to our team. Also more importantly, our CT6 customers tell us that after having Super Cruise more than 85% of them said they would only consider or prefer this feature in their next vehicle; 85%. And our VIP-based Super Cruise is getting even better with things like lane change on-demand, improved driving dynamics and more usable road systems. And this is launching here literally in days with our new Cadillac Escalade., We will have 22 vehicles with Super Cruise by 2023 including our high-volume pickups and SUVs. Utilizing our VIP platform Super Cruise will only improve with more future enhancements and more accessible miles on the road., And then there's Cruise. Our autonomous vehicle story continues with the Cruise origin to be built at Factory ZERO our Detroit-Hamtramck assembly facility. Last month, Cruise received a permit from the California DMV to remove human backup drivers from its self-driving cars. By year's end Cruise will be sending out cars onto the streets of San Francisco without gasoline and without anyone behind the wheel., So this is huge of course because safely removing the driver is the true benchmark of a self-driving car and because it brings the future that much closer. It's not the only news Cruise has made lately either. Walmart just announced it will use autonomous vehicles from Cruise to test an automated delivery service starting in early 2021 in Scottsdale Arizona., Customers will be able to place an order online from their local Walmart and have the goods delivered contact-free. This is only the beginning of the AV revolution and we continue to make significant progress with our AV development. We're convinced this breakthrough technology will change the driving world., So thanks for your attention. And now I would like to turn it over to Travis Hester, who will describe what all this means for our customers. Travis? , Travis Hester, Thanks Doug. From what Doug just covered, it's clear how far and how fast we're progressing on EV in terms of product and development. And it's a very powerful story. But we know that mass adoption of EVs requires more than winning technology and products. We need to address customer preferences and provide them with a new and exceptional experience., So while Ultium underpins our upcoming EV hardware, Ultifi underpins our customer experience commitment for those EVs. It's a digital unification platform across the entire journey: purchase, on-boarding and ownership. With the customer at the center of our growth strategy, our priorities are simplicity and efficiency with unprecedented convenience and flexibility., Unify consolidates many different customer experiences into one unified platform. A single Unify ID manages everything from payments and parts to loyalty programs, subscription services and more. A few of the key elements of Ultifi are we're going to simplify the shopping and purchase experience for EV buyers with new levels of transparency, speed and convenience. With our dealership network, we will use EVs as an opportunity to dramatically improve our industry's use of e-commerce and digital retail. You can see early evidence of this with the HUMMER EV clear and simple pricing with a fully digital reservation system. When customers choose to shop and buy online, visit the showroom, or a blend of both, we'll optimize those experiences. We have also rapidly enhanced existing online tools like Shop-Click-Drive with much more to come in 2021., Beyond the shopping process, we're building an entire ecosystem consisting of EV education, onboarding and ownership initiatives, designed to drive further adoption. And dealers will benefit from education activities GM is offering directly to the consumer like one-on-one interactions with GM EV experts. And software and services provide a major growth opportunity also a very important element of the customer experience., GM already manages mobile apps for all our brands with about 33 million interactions per month. We're launching a completely redesigned mobile application, which is really cool. And we will integrate and expand the Energy Assist feature so owners can monitor and control battery charge functions from their phone and adding a host of all-new features., We're also expanding remote personalization, real-time vehicle notifications, and alert features. In addition to the mobile app, we will continue expanding our over-the-air update capabilities. Our OnStar and connected vehicle expertise, combined with our Vehicle Intelligence Platform will allow customers to enhance their vehicle experience over time, through downloadable vehicle upgrades, through services, and through onetime purchases., Over-the-air is very important, because it can keep customers more engaged with our brands. We are ultimately demonstrating this capability currently at scale. We make over-the-air map updates to Cadillac models with Super Cruise. We've already deployed the Alexa over-the-air app to approximately one million vehicles, the largest over-the-air rollout of any automaker., And of course, charging is a key element of the EV ecosystem. We're looking at this as an opportunity to encourage mass adoption by building customer confidence in charging and making it a frictionless process. Our goal in home charging is very clear. We want to have home charging units installed before the customer even takes delivery, and embed it into the purchasing and delivering process., We'll sell a comprehensive set of branded charging infrastructure products to provide convenient one-stop shopping. We'll develop home energy management tools, to help the customer charge in the hours when energy is expected to be the cheapest and all in a one-click solution. To capitalize on the huge opportunity for EVs in the fleet and commercial world, we'll work to enable a full suite of charging solutions, fleet management software and energy management tools., And of course, public charging is critical as well. For example, our partnership with EVgo, the nation's largest network of fast charging stations, provides great knowledge of public infrastructure and EVgo will add 2,700 charging stations over the next five years. GM is looking forward to more public and private partnerships to encourage EV adoption for all of our consumers., And finally, the new customer experience we're building extends to a service that every vehicle owner needs insurance. And yesterday, we announced, the OnStar insurance program, which begins soon with a pilot program. In collaboration with our insurance carrier partners, the product will eventually use data from the vehicle's OnStar system to determine individualized pricing, based on driving behavior., Our vision is to make the insurance relationship, a more transparent fair and controllable experience that helps keep every driver safer. It's a natural way to leverage OnStar's trusted safety and security services, and it's another example of how GM's leadership in connectivity can help our customers potentially save money on auto insurance, while encouraging safe driving., So thanks for your attention, and I will now turn the presentation back over to Mary., Mary Barra, So, thanks Travis, and thanks, Doug. And I appreciate everyone's attention this afternoon. We've covered a lot today. So I want to reiterate that, electric vehicles are a cornerstone of our growth strategy and that we have everything in place to drive mass adoption of EVs and make our zero emissions future a reality. Our scale, our product leadership, our technology platforms, our services and our commitment to a world-class customer experience will distance us from our competitors, and it's why we will win., When we look at what has happened in the world and in our company, during the past three years, I hope you can see how far we've come in the race for EV leadership to achieve meaningful and sustainable growth. By this time next year many of you will have firsthand experience driving or crab-walking in our EVs starting with the GMC HUMMER EV, and then we'll be gearing up to launch the Cadillac LYRIQ. And right after that, we'll have an onslaught of mass market vehicles from Cadillac, Chevrolet, Buick and GMC in North America and in China., I know Brian has questions, so I'll turn the program back to him. And again thank you for your attention and I hope everyone is staying safe., Question-and-Answer Session"

Thank you everyone for joining us for our new session with Kenny Gunderman, CEO of Uniti. My name is David Barden. I head up telecommunications services and comm infrastructure research for Bank of America. And I'm really pleased to be here at NAREIT 2020 hosting Uniti for this session. At the bottom left of your screen, there's probably a Q&A box. If you want to type in a question that we might try to put in front of Kenny as we go, please feel free to do so. I apologize in advance if we can't get there. I think we only have about 30 minutes to kind of talk about all the things that Uniti is working on. For those of you that aren't familiar with Uniti, maybe Kenny I'll ask if you could give us just maybe a brief background on who Uniti is and what they do. And then we'll talk about kind of the future for Uniti going forward., Kenny Gunderman, Sure. Good afternoon everyone or good morning. David, it's nice to be on with you again and we're always pleased to be here at NAREIT. Uniti is a mission critical communications infrastructure REIT. So our strategy is to acquire or build mission critical infrastructure, predominantly fiber, focused on fiber. We believe fiber is the key to all of future network investments in the communications infrastructure world. It underpins wireless. It underpins fiber-to-the-home. It underpins fiber-to-the-enterprises. It's really a critical ingredient to broadband over the coming years., We think we're in the early innings of a very long investment cycle, five to 10 year investment cycle. And so, we're very pleased to be focused in this part of the infrastructure ecosystem. Today, we have a very valuable portfolio of real estate, 125,000 route miles of fiber around the country in 42 States, almost 7 million strand miles of fiber. That network is very under capacity, I would say. So, we're using roughly 10% to 20% of it. So there's a substantial amount of Lisa capacity on that network., We have a portfolio of small cells that we're developing. It's a relatively small portfolio, but we think that there's a tremendous growth potential over time. And we also have a portfolio of wireless towers and we add a larger portfolio of wireless towers, but we recently sold that portfolio at an industry leading multiple, but small cells and towers are important to the strategy as they are feeders into the fiber network and they're a natural extension of the fiber network., We really believe in anchor economics and shared economics beyond that. So our strategy is to focus on anchor customers like the big wireless customers, AT&T and Verizon, and T-Mobile to build wireless networks for them at generally 5% to 6%, 7% yields, cash flow yields, and then lease up those networks beyond those initial anchors to drive 10% plus cash flow yields on a blended basis., So very much believe in the shared economic model. As a result, our economics reflect that. So we've got about 97% to 98% recurring revenue, a very low churn 0.3% monthly churn, 80% plus EBITDA margins, roughly 30% capital intensity across the whole business and at average contract term of about nine years., So those are very attractive. We think appealing economics that that are conducive to a mission critical infrastructure. We've built our portfolio largely on M&A. So we were spun out of a major carrier called Windstream five years ago. They spun out the real estate underlying their network, which we now own. And so initially when we were spun out five years ago, we had one customer, Windstream, and 30 or 40 employees. And since then we have grown our portfolio substantially to where Windstream is now less than 70% - almost 60%, 65% of our revenues., So we've really grown that revenue base materially, and we've grown the portfolio of real estate materially over the past five years through M&A. So it's been a big part of our strategy and will be going forward. Over the past two years, there has been a lot of volatility in our stock in our story because that large customer Windstream, our largest tenant went through bankruptcy. And so as a result, there was a lot of volatility. But we said at the beginning of the bankruptcy that we felt very confident that our mission critical infrastructure was important to Windstream's business. And so as a result, our lease would remain intact. And as a result, we are now beyond the bankruptcy and beyond our settlement agreement with Windstream., And our lease did in fact remain intact. Our red payment was never disrupted and continues to be at the same level as it was before bankruptcy. So we're very, very excited about that. And so, as a result, we feel like there's a new beginning for Uniti. The Windstream just emerged from bankruptcy a month or so ago. Our settlement was just finalized a month or so ago. So a lot of things - positive things have been happening in our business. And we're really excited about 2021 and the setup for 2021 for Uniti 2.0. So, very excited to be here, talk to you about all that today., And David, I'll throw it back to you for any questions., Question-and-Answer Session"

23835,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4390419-alcoa-corporation-aa-management-presents-goldman-sachs-global-metals-mining-conference,William Oplinger - EVP and Chief Financial Officer,"Emily Cheng - Goldman Sachs, Emily Cheng, Good morning, everyone. Thanks for attending our conference. We are pleased to have here today with us Bill Oplinger, EVP and CFO of Alcoa. Like all other panels, we will begin with some opening remarks from Bill before getting into some prepared Q&A and questions from the audience., As a reminder, you can submit questions via the webcast or you can email me at emily.cheng@gs.com., And so with that, I'll hand it over to Bill for some opening remarks., William Oplinger, Thanks, Emily. Just some thoughts to start out. Hopefully, most of you are familiar with our company, but we're large vertically integrated aluminum company that has operations around the world, are really three segments of business., We have a bauxite business. It's one of the largest bauxite miners in the world. It's a very low cost bauxite mining operation, that's geographically diverse. We have an alumina refining business, that generates around -- produces around 13.5 million metric tons of alumina a year, very low cost system that is again, geographically dispersed between three continents and we have three of the lowest cost alumina refineries in the world., And then we have an aluminum segment that is a second quartile aluminum smelting operation with aluminum smelters geographically dispersed and close to the markets. We've also got a rolling mill that we run in the U.S., As we think about the strategic priorities of the company, last year we launched three key strategic actions coming into 2021. Those three strategic actions, and it almost seems like a lifetime ago because they were launched in October of 2019. Three things. We redesigned the organization to have a new operating model that eliminated our business unit structure and went to global operations and global commercial operations under a chief officer -- a Chief Commercial Officer., That's important, because we've seen a lot of the benefits of that flowing through in 2020 that was executed at the end of last year, resulted in significant overhead savings, but probably more importantly resulted in better operating structure and better management of working capital. , Secondly, we launched the sale of non-core assets. We're targeting $500 million to a $1 billion of net proceeds. We gave ourselves to the first quarter of 2021. We executed on a sale of our Gum Springs facility, which ended up with an enterprise value of $250 million, $200 million of that was upfront cash proceeds. So, we're making progress on our non-core assets sales., And then thirdly, probably most importantly, we put a number of assets under review. We have put 4 million metric tons of alumina assets under review, 1.5 million metric tons of smelting assets. And we will take -- at the time we said, we'd take five years to get that done. We're one year into it. We already curtailed our smelter in the Pacific Northwest, the Intalco smelter. We have launched a collective dismissal process. That's working its way through the system in Spain and for the San Ciprián smelter, we've permanently closed the Point Comfort refinery that we've made good progress 12 months in, 13 months into our strategic review that's ongoing., Then COVID occurred. And because of COVID, we took a number of actions. And I can tell you, we were very well-positioned to run through COVID. We've not had any significant operational issues, very proud of the fact that our operations were ahead of that. And immediately set up action plans to try to mitigate the actions -- mitigate the impact of COVID. , And we launched a couple of additional actions, some additional savings, but probably most importantly, the deferral of our U.S. pension contribution under the CARES Act., So, with that in mind, when I think about the future of the company, I think we have a really strong pathway to significantly improve our company. We've shown this year that we're lowering operating costs. We're managing capital, both capital expenditures and working capital very effectively. We're repositioning the portfolio over the next four years. We've taken significant actions this year, and that's just an indication of the actions that we will continue to take over the next four years. And we're focused on strengthening the balance sheet over time., Once we get through our portfolio review over the next number of years, we will have a first quartile, large bauxite business like we do today. We will have a first quartile cost position in refining similar to what we have today. And we will have a first quartile smelting portfolio, that's probably smaller than the portfolio that we have today., In addition to that, we will be the lowest greenhouse gas emitter from an intensity perspective of any of the major aluminum companies. And we'll continue to have exposure to all three parts of the value chain within the primary upstream of aluminum value chain, bauxite, alumina and aluminum., And then on top of that, we will continue to have best-in-class governance. And we see today that's probably even more important than it has been in the past. So, I think over the next few years, we are positioned to make the company extremely successful., With that, Emily, I'll turn it back over to you., Question-and-Answer Session"

Thanks for joining us. I'm Tim Anderson, the large cap pharma and biotech analyst at Wolfe Research, and for the next half hour, we'll be talking with three members of AbbVie's management team. Rick Gonzalez, who's the CEO and Chairman of the Board. He spent more than 30 years at Abbott and went to AbbVie after it split out. And he's worked of course in a variety of roles, commercial, R&D and manufacturing. We have Mike Severino, who's Vice Chairman and President of AbbVie, responsible for R&D and other expanded roles within the organization. He joined the Company in 2014. Prior to that, he was at Amgen and Merck; and we have Rob Michael, who's EVP and CFO of AbbVie. Prior to that, he held a variety of roles within AbbVie and the predecessor company, Abbott. And he joined Abbott in 1993., So, we're just going to jump straight into Q&A, given the limited amount of time., I thought we'd start with a high-level question, which is pretty open-ended. Pushes and pulls for 2021 as we're kind of closing out their current year and looking ahead. And you can talk about COVID impact or non-COVID impact, but how things are shaping up for the coming year., Rick Gonzalez, Tim, this is Rick. Maybe I'll kick it off. It's a great question. Let me start with COVID. Obviously, we're seeing infection rates increase in jurisdictions across the U.S. and really around the world. Trying to take actions, particularly ahead of the holidays to try to blunt the speed at which the infection is growing. And so, the real question is, what kind of impact is that going to have on the business going forward? I think, we'll see the majority of that activity occur over the next eight weeks or so, and hopefully, there'll be some mitigation that we see., I think, it will be somewhat similar to what we saw in the March, April timeframe, although not to the same extent. We saw really our business was very resilient going into that. And we saw the majority of the impact being on new patient starts. New patient starts have recovered somewhat in across the therapeutic areas. I think, we could see somewhat of a pause in further recovery in most of the therapeutic areas. We could see some minor impact on those hospital-based procedures. Aesthetics certainly was impacted in a significant way back in the March-April time frame. I don't expect that now. I think, the aesthetics practices, we've talked to most of them and they plan on staying open. They believe they put the right kind of safety mechanisms in place to be able to deal with and that customer base seems to be pretty resilient as well. So, I would expect that the aesthetics business will continue to perform well through this next phase., Hopefully, with the deployment of two effective vaccines as we move into 2021, we'll see further recovery of new patients going forward. It's an exciting year for AbbVie. We have a number of launches that we're going to do for both Rinvoq and Skyrizi, and other assets. I expect it to be a good year for AbbVie from a performance standpoint. And so, we're looking forward to starting the year., Tim Anderson, How much uncertainty with COVID? I guess, I'm wondering, when you give 2021 guidance, is it going to be a wider range than normal, just given the uncertainties about how COVID might impact things?, Rick Gonzalez, Well, as I said, I think we've seen the impact on COVID, and we're actually -- the only thing we'll really see happen through this phase is that we may see some slowing down in the new patient activation. We've implemented a number of actions to try to improve patient activation. I think, we've seen that that -- those actions have been somewhat effective. We could see some pause in that. But again, that's more of a leading indicator of the business because for the bulk of our business, it's chronic care patients who are under therapy that drives the majority of the revenue to the business. So, I don't expect it to have a significant impact. I would expect that from a range standpoint, we'll provide a range that's somewhat similar to what we've provided historically. I don't anticipate having to provide a range that's much broader than that., Question-and-Answer Session"

Thanks for joining us on this next session. I'm really happy to have with me here the President and CEO of Amarin, John Thero. Great to have you with us here. Thanks for joining us., John, it's been an unprecedented year for the world. It's also been an unprecedented year for Amarin on a number of fronts. And I want to say congrats on all the success so far. And I listened to the data yesterday, by the way, that you presented. So everything has been going well, but there was a speed bump. I guess, I just wanted to start off first. John, maybe you can make a comment about the progress in the U.S. and how you're thinking about the speed bump? And how investors should be thinking about the go-forward a little bit here?, John Thero, Michael, hello, first. Thanks for inviting Amarin to your conference. This is always a good conference and always a pleasure of speaking with you. Before I respond, I will be making forward-looking statements that are risks involved with all such forward-looking statements. Investors are encouraged to review our risk disclosures in our SEC filings before investing., I agree that we are making progress. There have been a couple of speed bumps this year. The one that's pervasive is that the COVID one, where I think things are getting better in that regard, but it's still highly volatile. And had it not been for COVID, I think, we would be really having a barrier., As it is, even despite COVID, if I look at other drugs and there's no direct competitor to our lead drug, VASCEPA. But if I look at other drugs, which in the past four years have had positive cardiovascular outcome studies, VASCEPA is at the top of that group relative to our growth., We really do feel as though we're just getting started. But the COVID has slowed us down. We're getting ready for further growth here as we're anticipating the burdens of COVID to be dissipating more as we get vaccines out and the world starts getting back to whatever the new normal will be., But I suspect that the speed bump you're referring to is more on the ANDA side of things. And there has been three ANDAs approved in the United States. They have been approved for a while. One has launched, that's a product from Hikma. Hikma has, not surprisingly and consistent with our expectations and consistent with what they've been saying all the way along, they've launched with relatively limited supply. They've publicly commented that their cost of supply is high., Not surprisingly, we've taken a decade to build up our supply efficiencies and capacity. They priced the product at 8.9% lower than the price of the branded product. So while it's in short supply, it's actually more expensive to a payer than is the branded product., So we're looking forward to continuing to grow VASCEPA globally. But in the United States, based upon the information available to us, which includes continued evidence of the large need for VASCEPA. And that data is suggesting continued limitations of generic supply, but also noting that the label for Hikma's product, for example, is a skinny label. It's only for treatment of very high triglycerides, which represents less than 10% of our prescriptions., And a lot of our business, for example, is Medicare business. If prescriptions start getting switched over for product that isn't AB-rated, and sometimes there's a bit of a misnomer that people think that just because you've got an ANDA, you're AB-rated for all indications. No, they're only AB-rated for treatment of very high triglycerides., So if pharmacies start switching over patients who are Medicare there, if you're violating law under Medicare, and our payers have contracts with us saying they're not going to violate any federal law. So we'll see how this all goes in the future. It's very early, so far, prescriptions of the generic product are very slight., We've heard some observations from people that the product may be not quite the same as the branded product, but we've not confirmed those yet. But it's early. We're going to -- what we'll see is -- we think a multibillion-dollar opportunity still in the United States, and we'll see what impact the generics have going forward., Question-and-Answer Session"

I'm Michael Yee, and thank you for joining us on this exciting session here at the 2020 Virtual Jefferies London Healthcare Conference. And you see, I'm here virtually in London right behind me., I wanted to introduce my friends here at Vertex Pharmaceuticals. We have the President and CEO, Reshma Kewalramani.

But I would point out that Vertex has been quite a standout because you have executed quite well throughout the year, even during COVID., So, maybe I just wanted to take a step back and turn it over to you and say, tell us about the progress with the CF business, which, of course, is most important throughout 2020, the U.S. launch, but most importantly, since I guess here I'm virtually in London, about the progress in Europe and what's coming about there. So, maybe just start with the progress with the CF franchise first., Reshma Kewalramani, Yes. Sure thing.

And with the launch of TRIKAFTA in the U.S. starting in October of 2019, at this point, the vast majority of U.S. patients who are eligible for TRIKAFTA are on the medicine, and we're absolutely delighted about that., We also recently received early approval for the triple combination KAFTRIO, as it's known in Europe, in August of 2020 for European patients. The approval came towards the tail end of August. So, we are in our early days of the launch in Europe. But, I will say that the experience in the U.S., the positive reception from both physicians and patients has translated across the pond. And while it's very early days, and we are launching completely virtually, given the pandemic, I am pleased that patients are getting access, and I'm pleased with the early metrics., I think, the important thing to mention is that while the approval for KAFTRIO has come through, and we do have access in certain countries, we're still working to get access for patients in other countries. So, very early days in the countries in which we have access and reimbursement, patients are getting on the drug, and that early days view looks really very good., Question-and-Answer Session"

My name is Søren Skou, and I'm the CEO of A.P. Møller - Maersk, and I'm joined today by Patrick Jany, our group CFO., So let me start by saying that we are satisfied with our third quarter results. And we're also proud of the fact that we have been able to continue to improve our financial results and continue to transform the company into a global container logistics company under the very difficult circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has, for us, meant lower volumes, global work from home, plenty of contingencies in ports around the world. We believe we are demonstrating that we are set out on the right strategy at the end of 2016 and that the disciplined execution ever since is starting to really deliver results., The work we have done in our Ocean segment with the 2 revenue lines and the tools we have developed there to be agile in capacity deployment, the acquisition of Hamburg Süd, which has provided us with scale and competitiveness, our continued focus on profitability over market share and disciplined approach to CapEx and the development of unique and differentiating digital products such as Maersk Spot is really paying off. And all of that has meant that we are able to deliver a better results even when the volumes are down, as we expect them to be for the year in 3% to 5% for the full year., Also, we are starting to have material growth in our Logistics & Services business, and you can see it in our results now. And all the work we have done on costs, in Terminals & Towage is enabling that we can deliver better results also here despite the fact that volumes are down. We believe it's an excellent quarter with not only solid results in Ocean, but also good growth in Logistics & Services that further highlights our strategic transformation, and that it -- has started to show in our financials. Due to supply chain disruptions of COVID-19, our revenue declined 1.4% as volumes were down close to 4% with organic volumes decreasing in most segments, however, slightly better than what we initially expected for the third quarter being a mid-single-digit decline., Despite the negative development in turnover, our results continued to improve. The third quarter was the ninth consecutive quarter with year-on-year improvements in operating earnings. EBITDA was up 45% at DKK 2.4 billion before restructure costs and 39% to USD 2.3 billion, including restructuring cost of USD 105 million. The strategy is working, as I outlined, but we also enjoyed tailwinds after a very difficult second quarter., Despite this fact that we are still in the middle of the pandemic with continued high uncertainties, we have seen a strong recovery in demand within transportation and logistics, which has led to equipment shortages, both containers and vessels at selected trades, which has been a supporting factor in the freight rates in the short term. At the same time, the oil price decline has had positive impact on our cost base. And these external factors have benefited our financials, although we have lower market share in geographic areas where the volumes and rates have performed the strongest in the third quarter such as the Pacific trade. The tailwinds from rates and volumes are accelerating into the fourth quarter. And when combined with the strong execution of the strategy, we now expect to deliver a Q4 which is stronger than Q3. And this is unusual and not our normal seasonality, but it has enabled us to upgrade our expectations for the full year to between $8 million and -- EBITDA of between $8 billion and $8.5 billion as announced yesterday. We are also making progress on our transformation., In September, we announced initiatives to close Damco freight forwarding and merge our airfreight forwarding and less-than-container-load business into the Maersk brand to further improve the customer experience and end-to-end service delivery. We are closing down the Safmarine brand and integrating that into Maersk to enhance customer service and we are further integrating the back offices of Maersk and Hamburg Süd, while we will continue to go-to-market as 2 separate brands with a differentiated service model. As a consequence of this, we unfortunately have had to say goodbye to 2,000 colleagues, and we have taken, in the third quarter, a restructuring charge of $105 million of which $40 million is in Logistics & Services and the remaining in Ocean., On the financial performance, we have continued to build on our foundation with improved profitability across all segments, which combined with our focus on capital discipline, has led to a free cash flow generation of $1.5 billion in Q3 and $3 billion for the first 9 months. This has continued -- allowed us to do 3 things in this quarter, continue to delever the company, acquire KGH Customs Services and to do share buybacks. It is worth noting, to put this into context, that when we acquired Hamburg Süd in 3 years ago in December of 2017, our net interest-bearing debt topped at USD 24.6 billion, which we have now reduced to $10.8 billion, including lease liabilities. In light of the development, today, the Board of Directors of A.P. Møller - Maersk has decided to initiate a share buyback program of up to -- of $1.6 billion over a period of 15 -- up to 15 months, starting on the 1st of December., The first phase of the program of around $500 million will be executed under the authority already given to the -- at the AGM in 2019, and the rest will have to be authorized at the next AGM, which the Board will propose. The decision to initiate a new share buyback round is supported by both strong earnings and strong free cash flow in 2020. And this, I also want to say that this is the last distribution from the proceeds from the sale of Maersk Oil or the shares in Maersk Total from the sale of Maersk Oil. In total, the share buyback program announced today, we will distribute close to $3.4 billion or 75% of the initial value of the shares in Total S.A., Now on Slide 5, the strong trend of improving earnings continues. Returns and cash flow have improved steadily year-over-year over the last 9 quarters. Return on invested capital were 5.9% last 12 months. And our ROIC in the third quarter was 11.3% annualized, up from 6.6% in the second quarter. Free cash flow before distributions to shareholders and acquisitions was $3.8 billion on a last 12 months basis. Along with the strong cash flow generation, we kept our capital discipline, which enabled our cash return on invested capital to reach almost 14% in the last 12 months. And given our guidance today, it's also clear that we expect to make it 10 quarters in a row where we continue this very strong trend. And I think this is one of the things that we had -- take particular pride in the fact that we're generating a lot of cash, and we will continue to do so. , In the third quarter, while we kept improving our financial results, we also continued our transformation strategy. Revenue in our infrastructure and logistics activities increased by more than 5% despite being negatively affected by COVID-19. EBITDA in Logistics & Services grew by 71%. The improvement in profitability was mainly driven by the acquisition of Performance Team and higher earnings in intermodal. And if we compare our performance in Logistics & Services in this quarter, we have been able to grow both our top line and earnings significantly above the average of the industry, confirming the strategy, including the acquisitions we have made. We completed the acquisition of KGH in September, and the integration is progressing as planned and contributed with a minor positive U.S.-dollar amount to EBITDA already in September. With this, I will hand over the microphone to Patrick, who will take you through the financials and the segments. , Patrick Jany, Thank you, Søren, and good morning to all from my side as well. Turning to Slide 8. We can see that profitability improved significantly during Q3, with the net result rising from $520 million to $947 million on year ago. The improvement came from all segments despite the decline in revenues as a consequence of lower volumes and can be mainly attributed to a strict focus on costs. Overall, operational cost for the group decreased by almost $800 million compared to last year. In absolute values, Ocean improved the most by more than $500 million driven by better cost performance and freight rates., Logistics & Services increased more than 40% driven mainly by intermodal and Performance Team, while the other segments, Terminals & Towage and Manufacturing, proved their resilience and increased profits despite very adverse conditions. Overall, our EBITDA increased to 39%, leading to an EBITDA margin of 23.2% compared with 16.5% last year. Consequently, EBIT increased 75% to $1.3 billion compared to $737 million in Q3 2019, leading to an EBIT margin of 13% compared to 7.3% last year. The EBIT in Q3 equaled the EBIT in the first half year., The other positions had a fairly small impact on profitability and mostly offset each other. Taxes increased given the higher profit base and some adjustments of tax provisions and tax assets. When adjusting for restructuring costs, the underlying profitability was even more significant, with underlying net results more than doubling to $1 billion compared to $452 million in the previous year., Now turning to Slide 9. We see the strong cash flow was the financial highlight of the quarter. Cash flow from operation was strong, improving 26% to $2.2 billion, on the back of an increase in EBITDA of $641 million despite of a small deterioration in net working capital of $108 million. Cash conversion was still high at 95% compared to 105% last year. Free cash flow in the quarter was $1.5 billion after considering capital lease installments, gross CapEx, net financial expenses and received dividends., We absolutely maintain our strict capital discipline. And for the year 2020, we expect CapEx in the range of $1.5 billion and our future contractual commitments of $1.5 billion. For the 2 years of 2021, 2022, we expect the cumulative CapEx to be between $4.5 billion and $5.5 billion, which is below depreciation levels. It is therefore clear that we will maintain our strict approach to capital allocation in the years to come, focusing on generating a strong free cash flow while maintaining our terminals and fleet and replacing some smaller older vessels and purchasing, more than leasing, containers given the economic advantage. We will expressively refrain from adding capacity. Free cash flow generation after CapEx and lease installments is and will continue to be the key priority., Now looking at the use of cash, we have, as mentioned, made the acquisition of KGH Customs Services, bought back shares to a tune of $98 million and chose to repay debt in the quarter of $810 million due to the strong cash position. We thereby paid back some of the COVID-19 additional liquidity reserve we took in Q2. The improved free cash flow led to a decrease net interest-bearing debt of $800 million in the quarter to $10.8 billion. It is worth mentioning that excluding these liabilities, net interest-bearing debt equals just $2 billion compared to $3.1 billion at year-end 2019. The strength of the cash flow over the last 2 quarters, combined with the reduction in debt, is also reflected by the upgrade in outlook by both S&P and Moody's., Let us now turn to the business development and start with Ocean on Slide 10. Revenue in Ocean declined 4.1% due to declining volumes of 3.6%, as COVID-19 still had negative impact on demand. However, the volume decline was slightly lower than expected and the cost base continued to improve significantly due to the continued agile capacity deployment, leading to a record-high utilization and lower bunker prices. This, combined with improved freight rates, led to a 39% increase in EBITDA and an EBITDA margin of 25.4%., As a further step in our strategy of improving customer experience and improving efficiency, we initiated step to simplify the organizational structure even further by integrating Safmarine into the Maersk brand and by bringing the back offices of Hamburg Süd and Maersk close together. As a result, we recognized a restructuring cost of $65 million in Q3. Further progress was made in offering digital solution to our customers like Twill and Maersk Spot. Maersk Spot, in particular, gained further traction. , On Slide 11, we have illustrated in a waterfall bridge, the movements in EBITDA compared to previous year. As you can see on the graph, the decline of volumes of 3.6% had a negative impact of $155 million, which compared to the last quarter, where the impact was negative $634 million, is less than expected. The impact was more than compensated on the one hand by the freight rates benefiting from a strong short-term environment, offsetting downward price adjustment on contract rates for a net impact of $284 million, and on the other hand, by a lower bunker price, which amounted to $312 million. Through agile deployment of vessels, savings increased by 8.6% in Q2, matching the demand fluctuation while also improving network utilization against last year in Q2 2020., Looking ahead, we will continue to pursue an agile capacity deployment strategy to ensure we support our customers and, at the same time, are able to protect earnings and cash flow in case we see changes in demand patterns or strong fluctuations of demand. The agility led to a decline in container handling cost of $90 million and a decline in network cost and bunker consumption of $98 million. SG&A costs increased mainly as a result of restructuring costs of $65 million. The combination of controlled costs, fast and flexible capacity deployment, higher freight rates and recovering volumes ensure the significant improvement of profitability in Q3. We currently see this good earnings momentum continuing into Q4, as also reflected in our revised full year guidance., Turning to Slide 12. Our average freight rates increased by 4.4% in the quarter driven by higher short-term freight rates driven by volatility in demand and vessel and equipment shortage. When we talk about freight rates, you need to remember that we recognize revenue as the container is being transported, so based on voyage days on the water. This means that if the voyage is 30-days long and only a few of those days are in 1 quarter, the rest is in the following quarter, we will recognize a smaller part of the loaded freight. That means that the strong rate development we saw by the end of Q3 will only impact our revenue and P&L in Q4., Our contract rates decreased as we continue to lower the BAF element to the contract rates as a consequence of the lower bunker price and maintain our focus on facilitating our customers' supply chain and helping our long-term customers meet their requirements through offering additional flexibility in those difficult times in line with our strategy. Total volumes decreased by 3.6% as especially backhaul trades contracted, which was partly offset by strong volumes on the Pacific. Latin America, an important region for us continued to be very negatively impacted by COVID-19, with volumes declining 13%., For October, we continue to see a recovery in demand, with volumes being up or slightly above previous year particularly driven by the Pacific and some recovery in Latin America. Going into the third quarter, where we saw volumes recovering, we have carefully matched capacity deployment and demand to the best of our ability. This has meant that our operational costs declined by 13%, supported by lower bunker costs. Unit cost of fixed bunker declined by 2.9% as a result of tight capacity management and higher utilization. It is key that we keep focusing on our cost base by using the active deployment strategy and we are quite satisfied with the development of our overall cost performance., The increased demand compared to the second quarter meant that a very few vessels were idle by the end of the quarter and that we managed to increase the utilization to a record level close to 96%. Bunker cost also took a significant drop in -- declined by 34% driven by bunker price decreasing 29% to $290 per tonne and high utilization. The bunker efficiency worsened by 0.8%, which was mainly driven by a marginal increase in network speed. It's also worth to mention at our reliability was negatively impacted in the quarter as a result of the volatility in demand. In many ways, COVID-19 has changed the way we operate in our customers' needs, especially in the digital space, where all e-commerce and digital products have seen an acceleration., And one example is our product Merck Spot, as shown on Slide 14. Maersk Spot continued to gain momentum and accounted for more than 53% of the Maersk brand short-term volume, up from 24% pre-COVID-19. Maersk Spot provides space and equipment, guaranteed at the time of booking to our customers, and this allows us to better optimize our network and utilization of our assets. More than 80% of the volume is booked by forwarders, which is largely the same share as our volumes as before we introduced Maersk Spot. We have, therefore, not lost any material forwarder volumes while introducing Maersk Spot., On Slide 15, we turn our attention to Logistics & Services, which, despite the negative impacts from COVID-19, reported an increase in revenue of 11% driven by supply chain management and the acquisition of Performance Team. Gross profit increased 35%, with gross profit margin improving 4.4% to almost 25% and EBITDA increased 44% to $131 million. The increase in profitability is led by intermodal, airfreight forwarding and warehousing and distribution. As part of our strategy to improve customer offerings and improve competitiveness, we also recognized a restructuring cost of $40 million as we have closed down the Damco brand and integrated the airfreight and less-than-container-load business into Maersk Logistics & Services. The acquisition of KGH Customs Services closed in September, and the integration is progressing as planned with KGH contributing positively to EBITDA already in September., Slide 16 shows the development of gross profit and EBIT conversion in our Logistics & Services segment, which has shown a clear improvement in the last year, supported by margin optimization in intermodal, a spike in airfreight forwarding and significant progress in warehousing and distribution, the latter led by the acquisition of Performance Team. Our EBIT conversion improved in the third quarter to 21.3%., As you can see on the graph on the right, we now have a nice constant progression of our gross profit and EBIT conversion, and we continue to work on improving this through growth and cost efficiency, including implementation of new IT platforms. Performance Team contributed with $58 million to gross profit and $24 million to EBITDA in the third quarter, a significant uplift from Q2 2020. The integration is progressing well as we are already now seeing commercial synergies towards our Ocean customers because of our expanded offering of warehousing and distribution services in North America. We continue to broaden our customer offerings, particularly in the digital space. And in July, we introduced Maersk Flow for the small and midsized customers and partners to take control of their supply chain from factory to end customer., On Page 17, we turn to Terminals & Towage, where EBITDA increased by 4.1% despite revenue declining by 2.3%. The improvement was driven by both businesses. EBITDA in gateway terminals increased to $274 million, and the EBITDA margin increased by 2 percentage points to 34%, while EBITDA in Towage increased close to 4%, mainly due to lower cost., Turning to the next slide, we have visualized the effects from volumes, revenue and costs on EBITDA of gateway terminals. Volumes declined significantly on a like-for-like basis, given the impact of COVID-19 as a consequence of a large exposure to Latin America, which has been strongly impacted by the pandemic. The volume impact varied across regions, with Latin America impacted the most with 11% reduction and Europe significantly down as well by 9.2%. North America decreased slightly, while volumes in Asia and Africa and the Middle East increased by 6.6% and 3.1%, respectively., As our -- as in our Ocean business, we also saw bottlenecks in our terminals business, especially in the U.S. and we are also exposed to a larger degree to the North-South trades, which have not experienced the same spikes as on the Pacific. As a result of the decrease in volumes, utilization declined by 13% to 71%, which had a negative impact of EBITDA of $36 million. However, this was more than offset by, firstly, an improving mix, which means that our volumes declined the least in the most profitable ports. Secondly, because of the challenges to the global supply chains, the quarter saw more storage income with positive contribution to EBITDA. And thirdly, we have managed to work on the cost base, for example, on SG&A, which had a $28 million positive impact. Lastly, the consolidation of Pipavav contributed significantly to the EBITDA as well., On Slide 19, we show the equity-weighted EBITDA for our gateway terminals, both consolidated and JVs and associates, which was largely on par with last year. This further underlines the stability of earnings of this business. The cash contribution through dividends in the last 12 months had been $189 million or 34% of the EBITDA with a payout ratio of 95% of net result., Turning to Manufacturing & Others. We reported a 2% increase in revenue in Maersk container industry and a 21% increase in EBITDA. This is partly due to the high demand in reefer containers and cost reductions. Maersk Supply Services has suffered due to a tough environment in the oil industry, however, has done a great job improving the EBITDA to $13 million from $4 million in Q3 2019., With that, I will pass the word to Søren for the full year guidance., Søren Skou, Thank you, Patrick. And as already stated yesterday, we upgraded our guidance to 2020 from $7.5 billion to $8 billion EBITDA to $8 billion to $8.5 billion driven by the very strong momentum we have right now in Q4. Nevertheless, we still expect global demand growth to contract for the year of 4% to 5%. And we expect our own organic volume growth in Ocean to be below the market growth. We saw further improvement of volumes in October, and we expect the fourth quarter that we would be roughly flat compared to this fourth quarter of 2019 in terms of volumes., Now in terms of capital expenditures, as Patrick has already been discussing, for 2020, we expect to be in the range of $1.5 billion, with the expectation of a very high cash conversion from EBITDA to cash flow. We expect to stay within -- well within the original guidance we gave for 2020 and 2021 of $3 billion to $4 billion when all is said and done in 2021. For the years 2022 to -- '21 to '22, the accumulated guidance on CapEx is expected to be $4.5 billion to $5.5 billion, again, with the expectation of a high cash conversion. When comparing the CapEx guidance for '21 to '22, it's important to highlight that we have postponed some CapEx from 2020 into 2021 and we will continue to be capital disciplined., Our CapEx level is still below depreciation levels, and it includes investments in containers and vessel replacement and automation in our container terminals. We remain committed to operating a network of around 4 million TEU. I also want to emphasize, we have all the Triple-E ships that we need for the foreseeable future. Even though we expect volume growth in the coming years, we will only be back to 2019 levels, probably, in terms of volumes in 2021. So we do not see a huge need for growth -- growing the capacity. We have replacement needs because our ships do get older every day, but that will be in the 10,000 to 15,000 TEU size, where it's not cost-effective to charter vessels., And then one final thing on ships. There's a not -- it's not a trivial technology risk that we are facing right now. We are working hard to find solutions to the decarbonization issue. And buying ships today that you get delivered 2 years from now and that last for 25 years is a risk when we do not know exactly what fuels that we'll be using from 2030. So for all of those reasons, we are not anywhere near a huge ship order. We need to replace, we need to invest in automation in the terminals. And also, we need to probably own more of the containers than we do because it's simply much cheaper for us., So with that, we will open up for questions. , Question-and-Answer Session"

Annually, U.S. independent revenue grew by 15% to approximately $1.43 million from $1.243 million for the year ended August 31, 2019. In the quarter, global independent revenue increased by approximately $152,000 from $358,000 for the same period in 2019 to $525,000 in 2020, an increase of 45.7%. Year-to-date, global independent revenues increased by 16.3% or $239,000 to $1.71 million from $1.471 million in the prior year. Gross margin for the fourth quarter and for the fiscal year remained consistent at 92%., Overall, expenditures increased by 15.3% for the year ended August 31, 2020. Of this increase, $280,000 or 9.6% is a result of one-time restructuring costs and $163,000, or 5.6% relates to our increased investment in our technology and business development. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter grew by 27% to $210,000 compared to $159,000 for Q4 2019. For the year ended August 31, 2020, EBITDA increased to $329,000 due to one-time restructuring costs and investments in product development for longer term accelerated growth., Working capital has declined due to the completion of the normal course issuer bid, totaling approximately $533,000 and also due to the adoption of a new lease accounting standard, which required the recognition of obligations under capital leases. As at August 31, 2020, we had cash reserves of $2.622 million and had working capital of $2.424 million., I will now pass you over to Fred., Fred Vandenberg, Thanks, Sam. Before Glenn gets into our business development activities, I am going to take a step back and talk about our goals, a little bit of the forest before the trees discussion and I will talk about our goals and how we plan to get there. And I think this will set a context on why I think 2020 was a really successful year., Our first goal is to acquire a much larger market share to expand globally do what we do, but do it in more territories. As we do that, our product, people and myself, are investigating ways to expand services, to expand what we see is our addressable market. This is really our second goal. We think there are tremendous opportunities. But for the most part, over the last little while we have prioritized on positioning for growth of our core platform. We focused the company’s efforts back on Play MPE at the beginning of 2018 with this first goal in mind. Since that time, we have grown revenue by 11.5%, but that growth really has preceded all the various things we are doing to accelerate growth and expand to new territories., There are really two distinct ways to grow the current Play MPE platform. That’s growth in areas where we have a significant presence, what we call, a network of use and the second is to acquire new territories and how we approach those are quite different. So, I would like to explain a little bit more about that. Growth in areas where we have – excuse me, growth in areas where we have an established presence comes from your block and tackling sales, better marketing, greater lead generation, greater lead conversion, good customer service. And later on as we add more services we will have more saleable products., We have seen independent growth in the U.S., for example, grow by an average of 10% – more than 10% quarter over quarter over the last 10 years and has in fact grown in every quarter, but three. To grow in areas where we have a presence we create and sell recipient lists. We do this in every territory where we have significant presence. You will see that our Indies revenue is up significantly in Q4 and pardon me, Glenn will talk a little bit more of the wireless. We have made significant improvements to our marketing efforts and to scale this market efficiently, we are moving towards a very user friendly self-serve checkout system., Adding a new territory is a little different. It requires a specific strategy catered to each market, a more thoughtful strategy and a little bit more patience. Within each territory, typically a country, that strategy is catered, but it has some commonalities. A market generally lends itself to a single dominant system as recipients generally want one place to go. While this is true, this is not always what we encounter. Sometimes we encounter a significant competitor, sometimes it’s a very fractured market. But generally, our strategy is to engage customers, demo the system, obtain trial use, engage recipients and obtain activity and then we just rinse and repeat and grow that network of use until we can commercialize it once we have demonstrated value., To do that, it requires a few things: a good system, quality business development people and marketing tools and the internal collaboration between operations, marketing and business development. These things are where I think we have made a tremendous step forward this year. In 2018, when we refocused our efforts on Play MPE, Play MPE was a very feature-rich and powerful platform, but it was PC-only based and required training to use. So, it was powerful, but not user friendly. This limited our ability to add territories. Since that time, we moved to an internet-based platform and just in October this year, so actually, after year end, we released a new version of a release creator that is more intuitive and accessing the more powerful features is readily available to nascent users., To get here is not an accident it requires a great product team. 17 months ago, we hired a new product – director of product. In September of 2019, we hired a new Director of Engineering and in February of 2020, we hired a new Senior Product Manager. Collectively, we are getting much more current technical knowledge, better development processes to improve our output and a great collaboration within our team. Our business development group underwent a significant restructuring. Glenn will talk a little bit more about that. But part of that reorganization was hiring our first Director of Business Development, which is Glenn and he joined us in April this year. We also hired a new Marketing Manager. And we are working to develop tools to assist in demonstrating the values of Play MPE. So our lead conversion will increase., When adding new territories, we have several advantages. We can say confidently that we are the best platform out there. We just need to execute on sales. In new markets, universal use generally opens the door. A great system is internally reinforcing. For example, in Canada, we have an entrenched competitor, but we started with universal use in January of 2020. We have seen that use expand and now we are seeing recipients voice their preference for our system. But I will let Glenn get more into that and I’ll turn it over to him., Glenn Mattern, Thanks, Fred. Hello, everybody. As you may recall from the Q3 call, there was a major restructuring of the business development group in the middle of the year as Fred was just mentioning. I was hired in the role of Director of Business Development in April, early in the pandemic restrictions and we began to build up a team with additional inside sales staff and added a reseller in South Africa. I should also note that in Q1 of 2021, we hired a Miami-based senior account executive to continue to expand our Latin initiative, which I will speak to in a few minutes. Moving forward, we would like to expand our sales efforts and add new territory to the strategic recruitment of business development staff and/or adding additional reseller agreements., The pandemic has changed how we approach customers as we have shifted to a virtual customer engagement strategy to establish and strengthen relationships with industry promoters, record labels and other key industry contacts. I am proud of our team for embracing and flourishing in what feels like the new normal. We know artists touring is on hold, but in fact, the COVID-19 restrictions may actually be increasing content production as we saw notable growth in Q4 on several fronts. A send within the Play MPE platform is defined as a song or a group of songs, say bundles, albums sent to an individual recipient. We saw an over 15% year-over-year increase in sends in fiscal year ‘20, with an increase of almost 20% in Q4. This improvement in sends comes from an increase in commercial use and adding seeding use, which should have a positive impact in revenue over time., We have seen an increase in prospective customer inquiries of almost 9% over the previous fiscal year, with a notable increase of 24% in Q4. And as Sam mentioned, Q4 currency adjusted revenue was up 5.3% year-over-year. A little over 45% of our revenue comes from independent record labels and artists from new territories like South Africa, the UK and Canada, but also in existing territories where our usage is strong. Our indie revenue continues to show impressive growth, particularly in the U.S. Since Play MPE commenced U.S. independent revenue in fourth quarter of 2007, it’s grown, as Fred mentioned, an average of 10.4%. Q4 of 2020 produced over 40% year-over-year increase in revenue from such U.S. independents., So why is this? What we do know is that we have better lead generation lead conversion. What’s a little more challenging is to figure out what we are doing right. We are looking at this in detail so we can consistently repeat. What we do know is that we are improving our business development team. We are improving marketing efforts with a more logical and systematic approach. We have an improved product on both the Caster and the player side of our platform. We have longer established use in new territories like Canada and South Africa and there could be market-related issues like COVID where artists is simply creating and putting out more content. The upshot is that I think all of these are true and the impact on our indie revenue and the impact on our indie revenue growth. We are continuing to recruit business development resources, whether as resellers or staff and we are continuing to enhance our marketing efforts. Our reorganized Biz Dev group is well trained, driven and coordinated with our operations, product finance and engineering teams. As Fred mentioned, we are leveraging more senior business development staff to aid in the new territories., In 2020, we launched a few new initiatives. Canada has been serviced by a local system primarily in English for a number of years. Play MPE saw an opportunity to displace this ingrained system that suffered from a lack of investment and user frustration with our stronger, easier to use distribution tool. Our list management team completed an in-depth review and update of our recipient list to include all relevant radio personnel. We formally launched our Canadian initiative in January 2020 as Universal Music Canada commenced distribution of all releases within Canada, some of which are exclusive to our platform. In March, we expanded this use to a second major label. Throughout the year, we continued to add usage by major independents and recipients at major conglomerates such as Bell Media, Corus, Pattison, Stingray and others. Whether Play MPE will be successful in the Canadian market or not will depend on whether the superior user experience and functionality of the Play MPE platform and our customer relationships will outweigh the effort of changing established customer and recipient behavior. We are very optimistic. And we have seen consistent growth of users throughout the year and in particular in Q1 of ‘21., We are very excited about a Latin music segment, which is huge, active and lacks an entrenched competitor. In 2020, we restructured and expanded our U.S. recipient lists and launched our list in Mexico. We translated our Caster platform in Spanish to compliment our Spanish language player. Over the course the year we began seeding content from Universal Music Latin entertainment and several independent record labels. We introduced our player platform to various recipients of key radio groups to begin engagement. We expect this market to add significant revenue. And we believe that the recent hire of our senior account executive in Miami will expedite our systems adoption and help us move quickly into Latin territories beyond the U.S. and Mexico in 2021., We continue to focus attention to South Africa, a country with a population of over 60 million, 11 official languages and a flourishing music scene. Play MPE added Warner Music South African trial usage to the existing use of Universal South Africa. Lately, we formed a reseller agreement with Johannesburg based Stamp Communications who bring a depth of industry context and regional knowledge. We are very pleased with the progress and in August commenced our first independent label sales in South Africa. We expect this revenue to grow significantly in ‘21 and again, leveraging our Universal Music usage to expand further into sub-Saharan market., Late in the year, we focused more efforts on expanded use from major independent record labels. These differ from the three major record labels due to their size and from this – and from smaller independent labels to their international footprint. Many of these major indie labels use Play MPE in established territories. Our approach is to obtain introductions through satisfied customers and leverage plan to use global label features. The superior features of our platform such as release sharing and permissions are attracted to these major indies who lack the resources to develop their own internal systems. We have seen positive results, getting numerous introductions, training sessions and some trial use., While we believe we currently have the largest worldwide market share for promotional distribution of music, we estimate Play MPE holds less than 10% of the addressable market. In 2021, we will continue to work strategically to increase this market share and establish reasons and look to expand our reach to new territories such as Latin American markets in Central and South America and potentially into sub-Saharan Africa. In conjunction with our product team, we are refining our strategies and relationships in other verticals such as DSP distribution, which stand for digital service provider distribution and reporting tools. The company sees tremendous opportunities in ancillary and complimentary services such as these., And with that, I will pass the call back to Fred., Fred Vandenberg, Thanks, Glenn. Because we release our results early in the morning, I get the opportunity to receive a lot of questions throughout the morning. And I thought I would before we turn it over to questions, I thought I would preempt some of them. So, one of the questions we got was to shed a little bit more light on what happened in Q4, specifically with respect to we saw indie label revenue grow by more than 40%, but total revenue grew by 5%. Sam shed a little bit of light on this and we have talked about this in previous quarters, we did have a loss of one customer in Australia and we adjusted pricing for a major label customer in the U.S. And this is kind of long overdue pricing restructure in the U.S. that was to be to be more in line with commercial rates., The loss of the customer in Australia was because they have an internal champion for a system that is used only by this customer. We hope to retain that that adjustment will work its way through Q1. So beyond Q1, I think our major label revenue will grow from there. We see other major label use growing and we see a lot of trial use with that same major labeling in other territory. So it’s not something that I am particularly concerned about. We do see the indie market growing faster though that’s where we I think we can really grow revenue., Another question is talking about churn. Churn is how quickly you lose customers or whether you lose customers. And that’s difficult for us to measure, because we are – we differ from a lot of SaaS-based companies in the sense that we don’t have monthly recurring fees from a customer necessarily or not all of our customers. We get fees when they use the system when they have a particular release, it doesn’t at least with the services we currently provide monthly recurring fees are isolated to our enterprise customers. S, trying to figure out what an average customer pays us and what our churn rates are is not something that can be easily applied to us. Suffice to say, we received a lot of new customers this year. But I think we will have to provide better metrics on that or metrics that will allow people to figure out whether our indie label revenue will continue. We are seeing really strong growth and I think as we can expand that strategic use in a new territory, we will continue to grow indie revenue., Another question was on the self-checkout system. That’s where we can really scale indie label revenue. Right now, they are primarily serviced by our operations team. We will – we are still working on priorities of which product features we build first. I don’t see this on the – within a year, but we will plan that to be finished at the same time. We are really scaling up using new territories. So, I think they will meet each other quite nicely., Another question was on director nominations. Some of you may have noticed that a new slate of directors was nominated by the former CEO. The company and our external counsel is still reviewing that nomination to see whether it was done properly. The former CEO says he owns 12% – sorry, sold 12% and retains 9% of the outstanding stock. I don’t believe this. It appears that he has sold substantially more than that, but his motivations, he has been pretty clear about what his motivations are, and they are very self-serving. So, we will likely articulate those facts if at times – at the appropriate time. Regardless, I think it’s highly unlikely that those nominations will be successful., Probably the most frequent question I get asked is about the buyback. Some of you may be aware that we repurchased 5% of outstanding shares last year. And I want to articulate about how we approached this decision. We evaluate the use of cash the same way no matter what the investment is, whether its acquisitions or hiring new staff or doing a buyback. We – at the end of the year, we had approximately $0.25 per share, when we are trading at $0.60 it’s a substantial amount of our market cap and our work were profitable and our revenue is growing. So, our cash balance is growing. I view the best return on investment right now is to grow staffing to increase use, which will lead to greater revenue, that’s easily our best return on investment and a buyback might send the wrong signal in that, but we are recruiting. And as Glenn said, we added executive in Miami to assist in the Latin music. These investments take time to achieve a return. We are currently investing a significant portion of our overall expenses in growth, whether that’s product growth or business development resources. So, given the choice, this is our best use of cash., Having said that, we need to make these investments in a responsible and coordinated way, we need to hire the right people at the right time in the right area. So there are some limits on how quickly we can expand these expenditures, while ensuring that they are done effectively. And at the same time, our revenue is growing. And we are already profitable. So, I think we can continue to grow that investment and staffing without creating a burn in on existing cash. And I think that will show up in revenue. Also, as it was obvious with the addition of the reseller in South Africa, we can get an alternative to investing in staff is to hire resellers or come to reseller agreements. And we can do that without upfront cost. Admittedly, I like having a lot of cash in the bank, but it’s not doing any work for us. 1% or 2% return isn’t that what we are going for. So without committing to anything, I think we will have a public announcement on the buyback very shortly., Another last – the last typical question I get is where – do we see significant revenue growth or what is our – where do you want to be in 5 years, those kinds of questions. And I think that we have seen some growth over the last few years, averaging about 3.5% or something like that. And that has a danger of misleading people into thinking that’s what we are going for. We have grown revenue in spite of the things that we are doing to accelerate growth, we have, really done a great job I think, improving our, our staffing, and that is starting to show up in improved product improved lead conversion. And that is the thing that I think will start to accelerate growth. We are not here to achieve single digit revenue growth, I don’t really like predicting where we will be in a year or five years or whatever could sometimes checking over territories takes time. And it’s, it tests the patience the Canadian market we have been in trying to turn over. And starting really about a year ago with where we started delivering with Universal, I think that will come to fruition very quickly. And once those efforts are typically binary, we are either successful or not. And I think we will be. So it takes time to, really add a new territory and grow a lot. But single digit revenue growth is not is not what we are here for. It’s to grow by a substantially larger amount. And so I think that’s all the questions that I had from this morning, so I will turn it over to anything that I may have any other questions that I may have missed?, Question-and-Answer Session"

Once again, we're bringing our results to you remotely due to Coronavirus. Despite that difficult backdrop, Gregor, Martin, and I are pleased to be able to report strong delivery and good strategic progress during the first half of the financial year., We'll be taking the questions later, but in the meantime, we will cover firstly a summary of recent progress in delivering our clear and focused strategy. Secondly, our financial and operational performance; and finally, the significant opportunities we see ahead of us to create sustainable value for both shareholders and society through the transition to net zero., Throughout the coronavirus crisis, we've been guided by our core purpose, which is to provide energy needed today while building a better world of energy for tomorrow. Doing so requires us to ensure the safety and well-being of our employees and total recordable injuries in the first six months of the year approximately 27 compared with 35 in the same period last year., In these unique ties, delivering energy needed today would not have been possible without the commitment and flexibility of our employees, particularly those in operational roles. And I'd like to pay tribute to them. Thanks to their hard work, operational performance has been strong. We're continuing to establish ourselves as a preeminent green energy company in the U.K. and Ireland., We've made significant progress on the £7.5 billion investment plan, especially in renewables. Construction workers started and key contracts have been awarded Seagreen and Vikings, and we expect to reach financial flows on the first two phases of the world's largest offshore wind farm Dogger Bank over the coming days. These projects alone are trading more than 1,000 jobs., And we enhance to plan in June to generate over £2 billion from disposals we've already delivered £1.4 billion in combined proceeds from Walney, Maple, Multifuel Energy. Gains on sales expected to total over £900 million, helping to recycle capital into our core green businesses. We've also undertaken prudent activity in financial markets to lead the group well financed, and we've announced an interest dividend of £24.4 per share and reiterated our commitment to delivering our 2023 dividend plan., More broadly, we've led the industry in making the case for an ambitious green economic recovery from the pandemic. And this week building on our science-based carbon targets announced in June, we've joined the UN Global Compact race to zero, committing for the first time to achieving net zero emissions across all scopes by 2050 at the latest. We are asked to be a principle partner for cop 26., We're committed to supporting the U.K. Presidency attempts during the next 12 months to reach a more ambitious global climate agreement in Glasgow next year. And today we become one of the first companies to publish address transition strategy available on our website outlining the social implications of net zero and our role in supporting fairness for employees, customers and communities., This all adds to the significant progress we've made in recent years to reshape and refocus the group on our core electricity businesses. Our networks and renewables businesses formed the foundational core of SSE. The central to transition to net zero, and are where we will be investing 90% of our ambitious CapEx program., Importantly, these businesses share attributes that leverage our core competencies. They are low carbon asset rich businesses requiring world-class skills in developing, building, procuring, operating and owning large scale complex electricity infrastructure that they played to our strengths and asset management, large capital projects, energy policy and regulation risk and efficient financing., But many of our European peers we see a strong logic to holding renewables and networks in the same group. We have a long-term strategy of capital recycling for growth across these core green businesses. And our ongoing disposals program will mean we will only retain those businesses where they're highly complementary to that core by their contribution to the transition to net zero., For example, thermal provides firm Flexible Capacity to balance the variability renewables, business offer has a key role to play in delivering net zero, the opportunity to develop both carbon capture and storage and hydrogen, which will help pave the way for decarbonisation of heat, transport and industry., Our energy customer businesses provide a valuable route to market for our generation in both GB and Ireland. In Ireland's vertical integration to mitigate risk, one GB we believe our energy customers will become increasingly important as a route to market, the demand for green corporate PPAs increases. Enterprise gives us a platform for growth in the growing distributed energy market for our trading and asset management capabilities will be important., And through EPM, we can deliver commercial synergies and manage risk across all our market based businesses. In our renewables business, there are a wealth of opportunities, we have projects already in development that will double our renewables output by 2025. We have an enviable pipeline with longer term prospects, all of which we believe will be required to meet binding government targets, and it could travel all renewables output by 2030., SSE is leading the development of more offshore wind than any other developer with further auctions still to come. Furthermore, we continue to see potential to export our end to end expertise across the renewables value chain to new geographies, in order to extend our portfolio further., Delivering on these opportunities will support sustainable long-term growth and create shareholder value, underpinning our ongoing commitment to remunerating shareholders with dividends. Doing so will maintain our strong operational and financial performance., I'll now hand over to Gregor, who will take us through our results during the first six months., Gregor Alexander, Thanks Alistair. I would echo your thank to our colleagues who have helped us to maintain the safe and reliable supply of electricity during the pandemic. I'm pleased to say that financial performance in renewables transmission and thermal has not been adversely impacted by coronavirus., However as forecasts in June, we have seen adverse impacts elsewhere in the group with an impact and operating profit for the first six months of around £115 million. This is a slightly lower than the guidance we've provided in September, and none of it has been treated as exceptional. Despite recent increases in the infection rate, our view and the lately feel your impact is unchanged. And based on our latest assessment, we expected to be towards the middle of the £150 million to £250 million range., In summary, compared with many other listed companies, we have been relatively resilient in the face of coronavirus. And we continue to take steps to minimize the impact. Coronavirus notwithstanding, we've delivered a very solid set of results for the first six months. It's really in the businesses currently held for sale. We have delivered adjusted operating profit of £418.3 million, adjusted profit before tax of £193.9 million and adjusted earnings per share of £11.9 within the expected range set out in September., Reported metrics also include the £260.8 million exceptional gains on sale, recognized during the period on disposal of Walney and MapleCo. With further exceptional gain in excess of £650 million to be recognized on Multifuel Energy in the second half of the year. Given seasonal impacts on our businesses, our focus is always on results for the full year., However, for the first six months in our core businesses, we have seen in transmission adjusted operating profit increased by 5%, mainly due to phasing of a load revenue, partially offset by increased depreciation charges relating to ongoing capital expenditure and operating costs. In Distribution lower demand and reduction in new connections activity due to coronavirus were the main contributors to 27% reduction in adjusted operating profit, although, £25 million pounds of this is expected to be recoverable in future years., Renewables saw reduction of 6% with adverse weather conditions being almost entirely offset by higher achieved power prices. The result was also adversely impacted by lower renewable obligation certificate prices and non-recurring GB capacity market income in the prior period. Over higher GB balancing activity, and then non-exceptional gain on sale of a 51% stake and Seagreen minimized the net impact., Finally, our investment in SGN delivered a lower operating profit this year, replacing almost other things, the impact of coronavirus, which led to higher unproductive costs. Elsewhere, several demonstrate value in complimenting our renewables fleet with strong performance in the balancing market for six months and exceptionally high availability across the period., Despite the prior period, including £51 million of non-recurring GB capacity market income adjusted operating profit only fell by 14%, reflecting the strong operating performance combined with again, sale of a 50% stake in Slough Multifuel. Business energy has already been facing challenging market conditions and coronavirus further reduced customers demand for Electricity and related services., That drop in demand led to £24 million loss from early settlement of excess commodity hedges with negative mark-to-market valuations. Airtricity performed relatively well with adjusted operating profit aligned with the prior period, despite the impact of coronavirus, although the full year contribution from the business will be heavily influenced by the winter months ahead., In Contracting business, which we're in the process of selling has also felt acutely the impacts of coronavirus and this has weighed heavily on results for SSE Enterprise. Finally, there was a significant reduction in the Europe operating loss for ETM, reflecting SSEs new approach to hedging. It is still expected to make small operating profit in future years., Adjusted metrics continue to be important in giving a view of the underlying operational performance of the Group. However, given that the disposals program constitutes key part of our strategy for creating long-term value, it is important to call out its impact in terms of real gains and real cash proceeds., As Alistair said, we've already delivered more than £1.4 billion and are now targeting well in excess of £2 billion in disposal. We sold a 25% non-operating stake in Walney to Greencoat UK Wind for £350 million. We've now completed the sale of our 33% stake in the asset provider MapleCo to Equitix for £95 million. And last month, we announced the sale for 50% share of Multifuel Energy to First Sentier Investors for £995 million. Again in this disposal will form part of the reported results at the year end. These transactions remain to more than £900 million in gains on disposals showing the value SSE can create., For clarity, we set out on this slide the clearly significant impact of exceptional items on reported profit. In addition to the £260.8 million exceptional gains recognized in the first six months from our disposals program. Further non-cash exceptional gains totaling £66.2 million have been recognized, including fair value uplifts on sale of stakes in Seagreen and Slough Multifuel and at least have excess coronavirus provisions following continued recovery of customer data., Our operating derivatives, there was a favorable £343.9 million IFRS 9 remeasurement recognized in the period, mainly from an unwinding of previously out of the money commodity trades. Capital and investment expenditure before project financing refunds during the first six months was £680.5 million with their own £570 million or 85% of that in our core electricity networks and renewables businesses., This capital investment includes developing with Equinor, the world's largest offshore wind farm at Dogger Bank, where we hope to reach financial cores on the first two phases in the coming days. Developing with Total will be Scotland's largest offshore wind farm at Seagreen, commencing construction of Viking, which will be one of the most disruptive onshore wind farms in Europe and getting work underway, when it was originally to Scotland following final approval by Ofgem earlier this year., At the full year, we expect capital investment expenditure net to project financing refunds to be around £1 billion. This lower run rate is expected to reverse in '21, '22 and '22, '23, when Spain is expected to be around £1.8 billion in each year. Probably £7.5 million net of project finance DevEx refunds, we will invest to 2025, almost 90%, which will be in our core businesses. Within this equity investment, we're totaling around £1.5 million in the period to March 25 in Seagreen and Dogger Bank alone., These projects will contribute significantly to the UK is net zero ambitious, as well as a green economic recovery. SSE has a strong balance sheet and the financial discipline needed to fund our spending plans and take opportunities when they present themselves. I thought in September of adjusted net debt and hybrid capital stood at £10.6 billion. This follows successful refinancing during the first six months of this year, through which we raised hybrid capital securities and conventional Eurobonds totaling over £2 billion. This means we have no significant refinancing or funding requirements for the next two years., We have good liquidity with £1.5 billion of undrawn committed facilities. And we will continue to be agile with investments, sales on core assets and acquisitions. Adjusted net debt is expected to be around £9.5 billion at March 2021. We can increase our ability to capitalize on the significant development opportunities related to net zero through financial partner, particularly in renewable., SSE is well placed to manage development with the selling then state to retain typically 30% to 40% of a project and working with equity partners for construction and or operations brings a number of benefits. It allows us to secure developer premiums and realize value at the earliest opportunity. It reduces our overall risk and financial exposure on large scale projects. It avoids a large increase in net debt there's no earnings. And it appeals to the different risk appetites of different partners at different stages of the project cycle. This approach optimizes value creation from our CapEx and gives us further optionality as we seek to make the most of our enviable development pipeline., And to that end, we hope to announce the father farms own have a stake in Dogger Bank by the end of the calendar year. In June, we said we would also consider in time extending a partnership approach potentially through sales and minority stakes and of course transmission and distribution businesses. Our position remains that we are open in the medium term to bringing in minority equity partners in networks, should we consider the release of capital to facilitate the realization of greater growth opportunities across the four businesses., In June, we also set a financial framework which incorporated requirements for funding over investment plans to ensure the message is clear. I would like to reiterate the key points today whether disposals program to secure well in excess of £2 billion. We believe our plan to invest £7.5 billion pounds over the five years to March 25th is fully financeable without any requirement to change capital structure. This would also be consistent with our targets improve our net debt to EBITDA ratio to be at the lower end of 4.5 to 5 times range between '21, '22 and '24, '25., Our S&P credit rating remains at BBB plus stable outlook, and our Moody's rating remains a Baa1albeit on negative outlooks. These compare favorably to peer companies while downgrade would be disappointing, we believe it will be entirely manageable on current plans., In summary, we are comfortable with the balance sheet and the target net debt to EBITDA ratio for today, and how they are forecast to fall with our disposal investment plans to 2025. This will allow us to capitalize on the opportunities to invest in further value creating projects on the journey to net zero and to increase EBITDA for the long-term., Over and above the disposals we've already outlined, sales processes are continuing for our contracting and real businesses, with a sale expected to be completed by the end of the financial year, and our E&P business where completing a sale has proved challenging, not least due to the prevailing economic circumstances. We are updating this at the appropriate time, but we remain committed to disposing of the business as it is neither core and nor entirely focus on delivery of net zero., We have what to do, in June we signaled we're exploring divestment or interest in SGN, while no final decision has been made, with appointed times to view options for the sale of all a part of our holding. Ultimately, our approach to disposals and navels capital recycling and concentrates our efforts on growing core businesses. While disposals of non-core assets will clearly have a short-term impact on earnings, which we estimate to average around 7pence over the next five years, delivering our ambitious CapEx program is ultimately what will underpin sustainable EPS growth., For our main renewables projects alone, we forecast this will either in 10pence by 26, 27. And this is EPS growth driven by high quality long-term assets, the form part of our renewables and net loss core. SSE’s first financial objective has always been to generate shareholders through dividends. Overall, financial performance in the year-to-date remains in line with the boards expectations, and on that basis, we're declaring an interim dividend for 2021 of 24.4pence., Looking further ahead, we expect to recommend a full year dividend of 80 pence was RPI inflation and continue to target IPI increases in the following two years, I set out in a 2023 dividend plan. This retains the total dividends paid to shareholders over 14 pence per share since 1998 and underlines SSE’s ongoing commitment to ruminating shareholders for their investment., Although uncertainties remain over the impact of Coronavirus on the wider economy in the second half of the year, this remains in line with SSE’s current forecast and weather conditions are normal for the remainder of the year. Then adjusted earnings per share for the full year is basically in the range of 75 to 85 pence things, including again and disposal for Dogger Bank., Reported EPS will reflect gains and disposals for Multifuel Energy, Walney and Liverpool and it is basic to be well in excess around in 50 pence, excluding any movement and re-measurements under IFRS9. So, in summary, notwithstanding the impact of Coronavirus, with a good six months with solid operational performance and good strategic process., Looking ahead, we're in a strong position to create lasting value for shareholders and to remunerate them with dividends going forward. Our ESP extensions or strengthening with growth options that are second to none, a strong balance sheet, we believe as a fully financial plan to build the infrastructure that is so badly needed to deliver net zero., And I'll hand you back to Alistair to look in detail at our future opportunities., Alistair Phillips-Davies, Thank you, Gregor. For just six weeks left in the Brexit transition period. Clearly there is a degree of uncertainty. We've carried out comprehensive planning for a range of Brexit scenarios. While we continue to monitor developments closely we are confident that resilience shown by business models through the pandemic will enable us to maintain the operational standards expected by all our shareholders., Any Brexit or Coronavirus headwinds are however far outweighed by the opportunities presented to SSE by the transition to net zero. Whether you believe the committee on climate change projections, or those national grids future energy scenarios, a number of things as universally accepted. First, the significantly more renewables will be required with the traveling of U.K. capacity expected by 2050., But currently in the process of developing more offshore wind than anyone else in the U.K., and see significant opportunities to build out our pipelines and grow our portfolio to the end of the decade and beyond., Second, the electrification of heat, transport and other sectors could double our electricity demand by 2050. With production of green hydrogen on top of this, it could triple. This will require significant long-term investments in both transmissions as we look to connect up the surge in renewables, and in distribution, where we need to modernize our networks to accommodate up to 5 million EVs, and a significant increase in heat pumps., Third, the new technologies like carbon capture and storage, hydrogen and floating offshore wind, all of which align to our core capabilities, but have increasingly important roles to play. The opportunities for SSE with our clear strategic focus on electricity and net zero our sustainable business model our presence across the value chain are immense., Across the Irish Sea, the story is similar, albeit on a smaller scale, and with other countries pursuing a similar path. There are strong and clear opportunities for SSE to play a role internationally., I'll now hand over to Martin, the reason he stepped up into a broader role as Energy and Commercial Director with a specific mandate to drive growth across the group. Growth in mind provides more detail on how our market based businesses are capitalizing on the opportunities associated with net zero., Martin Pibworth, Thank you, Alistair. We are undoubtedly a first class operator of renewable assets, which provides a strong platform for the group. Our hydro portfolio boasts uniquely long-term assets we have 78 hydro stations that outperform us are often underrated despite yielding close to 4 terawatt hours of production over the last 12-months and providing vital flexible backup to our portfolio under market., Our pumped storage and trust for years, and our flexible hydro stations including Sloy, Glendo and Affric have provided significant support to the system via balancing and ancillary services already this year. The importance of flexibility will only increase in renewables led energy system. And at Foyers, we can produce electricity in less than 30 seconds. And in Wind, we operate 224 offshore wind turbines and 1,191 onshore wind turbines., In short, we have hugely talented people operating first class assets. And we're building more of these assets. We have an enviable pipeline of wind projects. And this slide shows both our current ownership stake and an indicative future ownership percentage following any potential sell downs. This highlights the potential future value creation from these projects. And we have used assumed SSE ownership stakes in the right hand column as the basis for the following slides on our plan future outputs and capacity growth., For those huge successes in last year's allocation round three options, our flagship renewable projects are all progressing well. Right now, there is no other company in the world, leading the construction of as much offshore wind capacity. Seagreen will be the largest offshore wind farm in Scotland, and the deepest in the world. At 1,075 megawatts and with turbines with a rotor diameter 30 metres above the London Eye, it will have low factors are 54% and as expected to produce around 5 kilowatt year., With our partners at Total, we will be investing £3 billion, making it the largest privately funded project in Scotland. It currently has a 454 megawatt CfD, and we're progressing the build with a target commissioning date of December 2020. Meanwhile, a Dogger bank, we're constructing the biggest offshore projects the world has ever seen. With the longest offshore wind grid connection and the biggest turbines ever installed offshore at 3.6 gigawatts it will have a load factor of 57% and product around -- sorry about that., Meanwhile, a Dogger Bank we're constructing the biggest offshore projects the world has ever seen, with the longest offshore wind grid connection and the biggest turbines ever installed offshore. At 3.6 gigawatts, it will have a load factor for 57% and produce around 18 tarawatt hours per annum. GE turbines will have a 220 meter ROSA covering a sweat area of 38,000 square meters. That's nearly three times bigger than the London Eye. They will be installed by a vessel taller than the Eiffel tower., And onshore Viking of 443 megawatts with a load factor to 48%. It will be among the highest yielding onshore wind farms in Europe, producing almost two powerhouses of energy each year. At peak construction there will be 400 people on site, and we've reached a final investment decision on the basis of building it These projects from those are creating more than 1,000 skilled green jobs at a time when are solely needed., The great potential in renewables was considerable even before the Prime Minister's recent commitment to increasing ambition for offshore wind to 40 gigawatts by 2030. Critically, SSE by strong developments options even beyond the projects we had discussed, giving SSE renewables a continuous development pipeline over the decade ahead and beyond. Seegreen 18 at 360 megawatts could be built in the middle of the decade, and it is perfectly possible for Auckland bank at 520 megawatts to be built in Ireland at a similar time., We expect both to have opportunities to secure contracts in the next financial year. Our view of the potential capacity across the Seagreen projects has increased by around 1 gigawatt since June with Dogger Bank and Dogger Bank formally Seagreen 2 and 3 now its 4.15 gigawatts. Alone with no falls, adjacent to SSE JV, these are options for future CfD option rounds and it is feasible to all of these could be built by 2030 to support delivery of the Prime Minister's ambitious plan., Further field SSE is exploring beyond Ireland and we're in active participants in both the Scotland and the next Crown Estate leasing round. This is an enviable offshore pipeline, and it is complemented by a 700 megawatts on-shore pipeline and 1.5 gigawatts of newly consented pumped storage capacity at Cory Glass. We are also generating options overseas by establishing relationships with potential partners and building local knowledge in different jurisdictions. Clearly there are a number of potential pathways for our renewables fleets, depending on our successes in CfD and crow estate options, and as Alistair has indicated the pace with which we can expand internationally., This slide illustrates how our portfolio could develop, based solely on our existing pipeline. We set ourselves a target of contribution, renewable output, especially talent out to you by 2030 and with a strong pipeline and further upcoming opportunities to build on it, we have a clear line of sight to achieving that goal, targeting a trebling of our renewable outputs by the end of this decade, which we would expect to can triple our wind output. Delivering our current pipeline on average, over 500 megawatts of renewable capacity each year to 2030, and with upcoming to see better options and the work we are doing to identify opportunities to expand our portfolio internationally. We have clear aspirations to reach a run rate of at least 1 gigawatt of new assets a year during the second half of this decade., Low carbon thermal will be vital to the transition to a net-zero world providing firm flexible capacity, that balances the variability of renewables and underpins decarburization of industry heats and transports. Our development of a new CCGT at Keadby 2 is progressing well backed by a 15-year capacity market contracts at the highest price since 2017. It will be the most efficient CCGT station in Europe. However, this won't be the last unabated thermal station rebuild. The longer term future of thermal is in carbon capture, storage and hydrogen., We have credible opportunities to be at the Vanguard of CCS, and over a slightly longer timescale at Keadby, Peterhead and Medway. Keadby 3 in particular, progressing through the planning process, and as part of the zero carbon Humber consortium to secure early government funding, and it's well placed for future funding rounds. Through our strong spikes and involvement with partners in low carbon clusters, we are well placed to seize further opportunities and future opportunities in this space over the decades ahead., I'll now hand back to Alistair, who will cover our regulated networks businesses., Alistair Phillips-Davies, Thank you, Martin. Much of the renewables potential described by Martin ties in the, lies in North Scotland and transmission, which now has an internationally accredited science based carbon reduction targets and holds the key to unlocking it. Following regulatory approval for the 630 million Shetland HVDC link in July, construction began in the summer and the project remains on track for completion in Spring 2024. This link will tap into Shetland's renewables potential, including the Viking wind farm to help ensure security supply on the island. We'll support future earnings and regulated asset value not previously covered in growth forecasts for this investment not forming part of our RIIO T2 baseline investment case., Turning to Q2 itself, we were extremely disappointed when we saw Ofgem draft determination this summer. We have had constructive discussions, while we remain concerned are hopeful that often we'll consider the additional evidence and stakeholder support provided, including the provisional findings, the CMA appeal by a number of participants in the water sector, when it publishes its final determination in December., SSEN settlement will enable us to attract investments and create jobs from delayed progress on net-zero with a drawn out CMA process. Delaying investment is not a lower cost option for consumers in the long run. And we continue to engage constructively with Ofgem with a view to security the right settlement for all stakeholders. Our network for net-zero business plan sets as well justify £2.4 billion of investment during Q2 and since submitting it our expectations for the amount of investment required has only increased., We now see a clear path to earlier traveling of connected generation capacity from 8 gigawatts today to 22 gigawatts by 2030. This is because a significant portion of the growth anticipated in offshore wind is expected in Scottish waters, particularly on the East Coast as demonstrated by the launch of the Scotland leasing round in the summer. In collaboration with National Grid Electricity Transmission and Scottish Power Energy Networks with submit to Ofgem an initial need case for the East Coast HVDC link that will connect the north of Scotland to demand SSEN in the south for subsea cable. The latest network options assessment from National Grid recommends construction of this so-called bootstrap proceeds in 2029., The focus is now turning to the likely requirement for second HVDC link shortly afterwards. So in summary when considering the known transmission investments in the coming years, and the vast opportunities to transition to net zero presents, we expect on all reasonable outcomes, the transmission ramp will reach over 5 billion by the end of RIIO T2 price control in 2026, with potential for significant future growth in the years beyond., And while transmission networks will enable the expected renewables boom at local level, it will be for DNOs, eventually VSOs to deliver the decarbonisation of our streets and homes. The direction travel and electrification is clear to see and we have commissioned research that indicates a significant spike in EV ownership in our distribution operating areas from around 44,000 vehicles today to 5 million by 2050. We also expect a significant increase in heat pump installation over the same period., So this in mind, we need the right level of investment in the upcoming ED2 price control to provide the platform needed to make communities net zero ready. RIIO T2 business plan will like our approach to RIIO T2 be stakeholder led will engage with all parties for outcomes that create lasting value and meet societal expectations on net zero., Under the new leadership of this virtual is succeeding Colin Nicol is retiring, the business will be focused on performing well for the closeout of ED1 while seeking an ED2 framework that strikes a balance between efficiency and security the innovation and investment needed for decarbonisation of the system, network reliability and improvements in customer service., So we'll take questions in a moment, but before we do I'll recap what we set out today. During the first six months we've delivered strong operational performance and demonstrated the resilience and underlying quality of our business. Coronavirus impacts, EPS and dividend tracking in line with board expectations. We've also made encouraging strategic progress on our CapEx program, our disposable program and I'm further refocusing the group around our foundational core of renewables and networks., We are at the forefront of efforts to build back greener and we're working hard together settlements to T2 delivers both for net zero and for customers. We have a clear pipeline projects, treble our renewables output and quadruple our wind output by 2030. And financial disciplines are supported., We building more offshore wind than any other company in the world right now and with upcoming UK auctions and opportunities in other geographies, we have clear aspirations to reach a run rate of at least 1 gigawatt of new assets a year during the second half of this decade. We have optionality, first class capabilities and we are committed to creating shareholder value through the significant investment in the net zero transition., By aligning our business objectives to UN Sustainable Development Goals, committing to the race to zero pledge promoting principles of fair tax and playing our part in addressed just transition will reinforce our position as a leading ESG star and trusted partner to governments. Ultimately, we are delivering our clear company purpose securing the long-term sustainability of our business activities while operating simultaneously value for both shareholders and society., Thank you and we'll now open for questions., Question-and-Answer Session"

23785,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4390166-crown-castle-international-corp-cci-presents-morgan-stanley-european-technology-media-telecom,Dan Schlanger - Chief Financial Officer,"Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley, Simon Flannery, Good afternoon, everybody and welcome to the Morgan Stanley TMT European Barcelona Conference, unfortunately virtual this year. But we're delighted to have Dan Schlanger join us again, the CFO of Crown Castle. Welcome, Dan., Before we get started, please note that for important disclosures, see the Morgan Stanley Research Disclosure website at www.morganstanley.com/researchdisclosures. And also, we do have a Q&A box on the website, so feel free to put in your questions at any time and we'll try to get to those., So Dan, thanks so much for joining us. Again, I'm sorry we're virtual this year. But hopefully, next year we can be back in Barcelona. But it's very timely, given your news of a deal with DISH here. Up to 20,000, towers, fiber transport to pre-construction services; help us understand how this all came about and what it means for Crown Castle?, Dan Schlanger, Simon, thanks for having me. And like you, I'm a little disappointed we're not in Barcelona and very much looking forward to getting back there next year., Yes, we're really excited about the deal that we signed with DISH and announced yesterday. As you pointed out, agreement that incorporates up to 20,000 towers with some fiber transport, and, as you pointed out, some pre-construction services. Part of what we're excited about is just the scale and scope of it. The 20,000 towers is a pretty significant number. DISH to-date has really spoken about 15,000 towers being necessary to meet their build-out requirements, which is the first phase of their built-out requirements. And what we now see is that if they're getting into a discussion with us for up to 20,000 towers, we feel that that's a meaningful portion and really sets us up well for getting, like I said, a meaningful portion of their of their build now., As we look at it, there are some factors that led us to this, I think basically, this is one of the first times that we've come up and agreed to something like this, that is supporting a nationwide network build. Historically, when we've negotiated MLAs with our customers, they've been on the back of us purchasing towers from them, or portfolios or towers from them, or an extension or amendment of those types of MLAs; this is how'd you build a new network from scratch., And we think that what we were able to do is negotiate with DISH because we bring value. And the value we bring is, first and foremost, the scale of our tower portfolio. We have 40,000 towers in the US. That's the largest tower portfolio along with AMT [ph], as we're kind of tied at that point. But having that scale is important because giving access to up to 20,000 of them means that you got to have more than 20,000, because it's not going to be that every tower or something that they're going to want to be on., So the scale is really important, we believe, where our towers are, which are really concentrated in the top hundred markets in the US and as DISH is focused on deploying out to a population target, being in the top hundred markets in the US is really important. Then finally, I think the ability to offer fiber transport is really important, as well. And it was important to them, important enough to incorporate into the agreement. But also important enough to put in a press release announcing the agreement, that because they're building a network from scratch, and because they want it to be a virtualized network where some of the equipment is not located directly at the tower site, that fiber is a necessity to making a network like that work., And our ability to provide not only towers, but a full network solution, we believe, was helpful in the discussions we had with them. And it's just a proof point to the overall strategy that we've been embarking on over the last 10 years, and really the last three or three to five in earnest, of buying fiber, having fiber or being able to build small cells and really trying to solve network problems for our customers, as opposed to having a single source of a product to sell. And we think that that really changed the discussion with DISH and tilted in our favor., Simon Flannery, Right. And you mentioned the virtualized network, how do you think about a DISH installation versus a standalone 5G network around based versus a traditional LTE deployment in terms of the revenue opportunity and other economics for you?, Dan Schlanger, I'm not going to get into the specific financial aspects of the transaction in the agreement we got into, but I will say that the purpose of the tower is to allow vertical structure on which antennas can be hung to propagate spectrum. And the wireless network is only wireless because those antennas are at height, and they can push out wavelengths that carry data. None of that changes with a virtualized network, you need the same equipment, the same antennas, the same ability to push up that spectrum. And therefore, the value of the tower is not significantly changed in a virtualized network or the O-RAN network, however you want to call it, versus traditional., Now, what does change is where some of the electronics lie and whether those are at the base of a tower or a more centralized location. And that could have a small impact, but not a major impact on the value of the tower. Because really, what we're doing is, like I said, we're selling vertical real estate on which to hang antennas, and that is the core of the network no matter what happens. And without that, you can't get it to be wireless. So we don't think that there's a significant change in the potential for us to benefit from a build-out like the one that DISH is pursuing., Simon Flannery, Okay. And you said you weren't providing financial guidance, but what needs to happen for you to start recognizing revenue from this transaction?, Dan Schlanger, Yes, as I mentioned before, this is a new thing. And so, it has a bit of some accounting quirks to it. In order to get straight line revenue, or revenue associated with this contract, that is a concept that only works for lease accounting, and lease accounting only kicks in when a specific asset has been leased. So we don't recognize revenue in this contract until specific towers are utilized by DISH and equipment goes on those towers. And once that happens, we'll start to recognize revenue. But I'll caution you not -- because we've had this question before, I caution you not to conflate that with the fact that somehow the economics have changed, that has nothing to do with economics or structure. It's just the fact that we can't recognize revenue on a lease until the lease actually happens. And the lease only happens when they go along to the tower., Simon Flannery, Great. Okay. Well, that's a good segue into 2021 guidance, you guided to strong AFFO growth at 10%, I think, at the midpoint on a per share basis, you raised your dividend 11%. So clearly, you feel pretty constructive about 2021. So that's go through the key elements of that guidance and to the extent that you contemplated this DISH deal, is that in there already?, Dan Schlanger, Sure. So the key elements of our guidance at any point are based around major assumptions of activity levels, how much are we going to do across our business and tower, small cells and fiber, the capital is associated with that. And then the finances, those are the key drivers for business, or I think of any business, but those are the ones that we think about a lot., As we look out into 2021, we believe that on tower basis, our growth is going to accelerate from what we think is going to be in the 5% range in 2020 to the 6% range in 2021, as we see an increase in activity, along with a reduction in churn in our business. On the small sell side of the business, we think that the revenue growth will remain very consistent between 2020 and 2021, in the mid-double digits, 15%-ish per year at a revenue level. And the fiber solutions growth will be consistent between 2020 and 2021, around 3%. So overall, our business is growing at 6% at the revenue. Importantly, though, we were able to reduce the capital we're spending by $400 million from 2019 going into 2020. Because we are reducing some of the -- we're not continuing to book some of the really large fiber projects that we had that came with some historical acquisitions we made, we finished those projects. So we don't think that those are going to continue, and therefore, some capital comes down because of that., But more importantly, our capital is coming down because the small cell backlog we have for 2021 is more weighted to colocation, where we already have assets in the ground, than it is to anchor builds where we're building assets from scratch. So our typical balance has been somewhere between 70% and 80% anchor build. And what we see going into 2021 is that that number is around 60% anchor build and 40% colocation, just because of the bookings we had that led up to the 21 installations for small cells, and that reduces the capital expenditure intensity of the business, because like I said, there's assets already in the ground and we're reutilizing that capital., That's the business model we've always been in, which is put assets, long term assets, that are the basis of communications, put that infrastructure in place share it among multiple customers through colocation and make money for our shareholders. And that's coming through in a proof point that we're seeing in 2021. And then lastly, on the financing side, we're just assuming the appropriate amount of financing, but we don't believe that we need to sell any equity in order to get there, because we think that the natural deleveraging of our business through the incremental EBITDA we will generate will allow us to continue to access debt markets and maintain our investment grade rating. So when you put all of that together, that's what's driving a 10% increase in our AFFO per share., When you go back to the tower business, and to specifically answer your point around DISH, we have said during our third quarter call where we announced our outlook for 2021, that there was a limited amount of new leasing activity associated with DISH. That is still the case, we're not updating our outlook at this point, because it really was based on an assumption we made around the timing of the activity from DISH. And that timing is based on their receipt of a lot of equipment that needs to go on the towers and elsewhere on their network. And they have been very open about this publicly that they believe that that will happen until the second half of next year, which doesn't leave a lot of time for adding a lot of new leasing activity to our business; so it's a limited amount of new leasing activity from [indiscernible]., Simon Flannery, Great. So taking that, does that then assume that from an industry that's in a little bit of an air pocket here, with T-Mobile and Sprint just ramping up, that we're going to see a pretty strong accelerating trend through 2021, so that it will probably have the highest growth rate exiting 2021 into 2022 for the tower business?, Dan Schlanger, We think that our growth will be skewed a bit towards the back half. But that's a normal occurrence for our business. I wouldn't call out that there's a strong acceleration soon. But we do think that, as you pointed out as, as some of the activity that we expected to happen earlier in 2020 got moved out into later in 2020 and 2021, that we think that there's good growth through 2021, and that the back half would be a little bit more growth in the first half., Simon Flannery, And American Tower signed a master lease agreement with T-Mobile recently, you have not announced a new agreement. Is there any likelihood or necessity to do that? You obviously have much longer-term contracts on the Sprint side of things, so what's the position there?, Dan Schlanger, Yes, as you pointed out, on average, we have five years left on our agreements with Sprint and T-Mobile, which is not just T-Mobile. And that was a deliberate move from us, where we renegotiated with Sprint and T-Mobile a couple years ago, so that we pushed the terminations of those -- the expirations of those agreements much farther into the future, because we were looking at the potential of Sprint and T-Mobile coming together. And T-Mobile in their past practice has been very good about going after synergies and we expected that that would be something that would be focused on in this transaction, as well. It turns out they have been focused on that. And it turns out that they are very good at it. And our strategy, and our thinking has come to be beneficial and help us at this point. Because we have pushed out the average maturity expiration of the agreements by five years, meaning we have time to negotiate with T-Mobile. And during that time, we anticipate there's going to continue to be 30% to 40% incremental demand year-over-year for wireless data. And as that continues to grow, we believe that our customers, including T-Mobile, but also including the rest of our customers and the big three carriers, as well as DISH, we'll continue to spend on their network to meet that demand., And we think that that gives us a lot of opportunity to have good discussions with T-Mobile because they're going to want to utilize our towers to make sure they're reaching their consumers the most efficiently and effectively they can and that we understand there are some churn events, where they are going to decommission some sites, and we believe they will. But the balance of those things, spending on the network versus the churn events, we're not sure how that plays out over five years. I think over one year, we'd be much more concerned that the churn would outweigh any new leasing, but over five years, we feel like we have a lot more of a balanced conversation that we can have with T-Mobile. So we don't have a necessity to enter into an MLA. We have MLAs with them now that would cover the type of activity we're talking about. But of course, we want to enter into something that we believe with them would be mutually beneficial, that could smooth things out for both of us, give us both more certainty, give us both more predictability and ease of use with each other. And as long as we can come up with something that met all of those criteria, I think that we would come up with an agreement. Otherwise, we can operate as we have been under the curve., Simon Flannery, Okay. So stay tuned, I guess. And remind us of the overlap exposure?, Dan Schlanger, Yes. Where we are -- we have both, Sprint and T-Mobile, on a single tower, the Sprint revenue associated with those towers in the neighbourhood of 5% to 6% of our total revenue. And the reason we're identifying Sprint is because T-Mobile has been very open about the fact that they want to take down the Sprint network and put it onto the T-Mobile. So they won't take both down. And so, we're just assuming that it's going to be Sprint, and that's in the 5% to 6% of our total revenue range., Simon Flannery, Great. So one of the most common questions I get about the towers is, what does 5G mean for the tower industry? And, we've been talking around so far in this conversation with DISH's 5G build-out and so forth. But how do you see 5G benefiting Crown over the next decade or so? What are the most relevant flow through benefits for infrastructure?, Dan Schlanger, I think anytime that our customers, the carriers, open up network capacity for consumers and other users to utilize, it's good for our business, because what they're doing is adding equipment to push more spectrum across the network. And as long as there's more equipment being added to our site, that's good for the business. The last time that happened was the transition from 3G to 4G. And there was a tremendous amount of activity on towers that led to significant growth in our business that has continued through today, where we're still seeing that activity, still seeing that growth. And something that we think will continue for a period of time, as well in the future, is the continued spending on 4G. As we move into 5G, it's going to create a network that is both lower latency and higher speed, which will allow for different use cases. But also to allow for a significant increase in the number of connections that can happen to the network, meaning that you wouldn't have to kick off an individual who's paying $40 or $50 a month to connect to the network, in order to connect a sensor that would be much less valuable., You can have both of those things happening at once, at very low latency, at very high speeds. And as we move, therefore, from connecting people to connecting things, including those types of sensors, we believe it will open up a myriad of monetization opportunities for our customers to where they can put in that type of network, increase the capacity of it, change the architecture of it, and the underlying drivers of it so that we get that capacity. And that will lead them to be able to generate more returns on their capital, which in turn will allow them to spend more on their networks. And we believe they will have that opportunity and that will occur and that will allow or put them in a position of utilizing both towers and small cells overtime. Because the 5G architecture will require significant more density than towers will allow, we believe that small cells will be a huge beneficiary of the move into 5G. Towers will still remain the most effective and most efficient way, most cost-effective and most efficient way to deploy spectrum over large swaths of both population and geographic area. But when you get into 5G, you need to be denser so that that low latency can happen and the high speed can happen, and all of those sensors and things can be connected in denser areas. It requires more density than these towers could accommodate, which is where small cells come in., And we are the largest third-party provider of small cells beyond 80,000 miles of fiber, in the top markets in the US, and we have a total pipeline or under development and un- aired 70,000 small zones. But as a large business that continues to grow like we said earlier at 15% per year, and we think that there's a lot of runway for that because 5G will drive density required that necessitates small sells, and therefore, colocation on assets we already have, as well as us having the opportunity to build new assets in those top markets, which is why we're so excited about the strategy that we've pursued over the last several years., Simon Flannery, Right. And I think that small cell positioning is one of the biggest differences between you and your peers, who generally focus more on emerging market macro sites as their expansion vector. Can you help us understand that the lease up the colocation that you're seeing on the returns and I know you've started to provide some better disclosure around that, so thank you for that. But, what can you point to help investors get comfortable that this really does have some of the attractive return characteristics that you've been projecting?, Dan Schlanger, Yes, I think what you talked about is a lot of what we've done, We have broken out in our second quarter earnings presentation, five markets that we will continue to track on a yearly basis to show the progression of number of nodes, density of nodes, amount of enterprise fibre revenue, and ultimately, the returns in those margins. And you'll see the progression over time and you'll see whether colocation is occurring and if it is, whether it's driving returns. But until then, what we can show is that in 2021 in our outlook, as I was mentioning previously, we're showing lower amount of CapEx for a similar amount of revenue growth, which means the capital intensity is coming down. And that's because of more colocation. So we have proof points both in those markets, those five markets we talked about. You can see, for instance, in Orlando, there's significant colocation and a significant return., And then, overall, you can see our business reducing capital intensity and driving the same growth, that all these are proof points that colocation is happening, and that it drives the types of returns we've been talking about. And we just continue to think, or we think that we will continue to add that type of disclosure and have that disclosure. And as the returns and the metrics actually come out, it'll support our -- what we've said all along, and what we've said all along is based on our history, it's not like we're just guessing that this is going to happen, it's based on what we've actually seen happen across the different appointments of small cells across the US. So we feel really good about the future for small cells. We think that for all the reasons I was just discussing, there's a tremendous revenue opportunity, a tremendous activity level that is going to be directed towards small cells, and that that's going to generate significant returns for us, as we continue to have the right assets, the right fiber assets in the right markets, and have the relationships with the right customers to be able to collocate and utilize those assets over and over., And by doing that, we're able to do is reduce the costs for our customers, both implementation and operation of their network, much like we have with towers. The reason that we're in existence is because we are able to share that infrastructure among multiple customers, which lowers the cost for any one user. And that's just like any other shared infrastructure model. And as we continue to focus on driving that value, driving our cost structure down so that we can drive more value to our customers, so they use us more and more, we think we'll be able to accelerate our small cell business. We're really focused, both in the near and long term, on efficiencies in our business, driving those efficiencies as much as we can, getting our cost structure as lean as it can be, while still positioning ourselves for the future. And that's both on a capital and operating expense side., So we're really looking at, how do we drive the right amount of value for our customers by being the most efficient., Simon Flannery, And one of the things that -- it seems like small cells has even more of a barrier to entry on in terms of scale, lots of people can put up five or 10 macro towers at a time. But it seems like that's a harder market entry. So can you just talk about the platform that you have? And how that it's hard to replicate and, therefore, gives you a better positioning with your potential customers?, Dan Schlanger, Yes, I actually think you said it well. Building a tower is not all that difficult. It is difficult now, because of some zoning and permitting restrictions on building towers, but the physical act of building a tower, you get a plot of land, you get the people who own the plot of land either sell it to, or your lease it to you and then you build a structure on it. And as long as that's in the right place, antennas will go on to deploy the spectrum to deliver wireless service to consumers. And it takes time, and it takes effort because there are permanently in zoning restrictions, as I just mentioned. But it's basically a pretty limited negotiation with either landowners or a single homeowners association, something like that. With small cells, because we're in the right of way we're burying fiber in the right of way. And it's a distributed network. We pass lots of buildings, lots of companies, lots of small businesses, we pass places of worship, we pass people's homes. Everybody who we pass has some input into whether they want that permit to be granted or not. And so, the local governments listen to that input, and then come up with whether to give us the permit, or to allow us to be zoned to do it or not., And that's the majority of the negotiation that we go through is, how do we get approval to get these things built. And because it is a much larger scale from a geographic standpoint, one tower is one tower, a small cell system can be 500 small cells over a wide area, we have to talk to all of those constituents and make sure that they're comfortable. And our stance has been to try to work as well as we can to make the small cells as innocuous as possible, and blend into the cityscape as much as possible so that we can get that approval. And it takes a long time. It takes discussions with the municipalities, it takes discussions with all those different constituents that we've passed., And the scale of it is hard to do, because we're not building 10 or 20 anymore. Like I said, we're building 500 at a time. So you have to have some pretty good expertise, like the expertise and capabilities we've developed over the last 10 years building small cells, and to do that in multiple markets at the same time, which is how our customers are pushing us to deliver for them, it takes a scale that's national, that was never true in the tower business, you could have a very localized tower company. That's not true in the small cells, it needs to be a national business. And as we have first mover advantage, both in terms of the assets we have in the top markets in the U.S. and the capabilities we've developed across the nation, we believe we've positioned ourselves extremely favorably competitively to get a disproportionate share of small cells going forward., And given what we were talking about earlier, that we think small cells are going to be a big part of the 5G network architecture in the future, that it just looks like a very good setup for us as we execute our strategy., Simon Flannery, Question coming in, how easy is it to collocate on a small cell your different types of street architecture? What's your typical ability or just go 50 meters down the street? And are you able to invest in ones that are easier to collocate or does it just depend on the market?, Dan Schlanger, It's a really good question. And I think we're trying to clarify is that the colocation we talked about on a small cell system is actually collocating on the fiber. So as long as we put another small cell on an existing amount of fiber that is colocation, because about 80% of the capital goes into the fiber. And it's not the fiber itself, it's actually digging up the street, burying the fiber and putting the street back again. And 80% of our capital goes into that fiber build process. So as long as we can utilize that fiber over and over and over again, that's what we're collocated on. Now, it is obviously better if we can go on a same pole colocation because that reduces our cost of the incremental colocation. But when we talk about colocation economics, have a mix of same pole colocation where we actually put another customer on the existing infrastructure, vertical infrastructure, not well defined [ph]. What we would call next pullover [ph], which is at your point, Simon, going 50 meters down the road where we already have fiber. Or what we would call a very small ladder, where we have to build a little tiny bit of fiber off the backbone we have, that mix is the colocation we would speak of. And it is not always easy to collocate on the same pole, there are restrictions that cities put up on the size of equipment that can go on any one pole, they typically limit it, for the most part to about two customers per pole. So we can have two nodes on a single pole, but sometimes it's more and sometimes it's less, it really depends on the set., When we talk about our economics, though, we talked about the first anchor build being 6% to 7% returns and that's what we generate off of a Greenfield anchor build. When we add a second tenant or second customer to that system, collocating again on the fiber itself, not necessarily on the same pole, that gets us to low-double digit, let's call it 10% to 12% returns where we cleared out cost capital. You add a third tenant or a third customer to that same system, the same fiber system, and we get to make the high team's returns. So we would clear our cost capitalized significant amount by the third tenant. Like I said, though, that's a mix every time we say that, that's a mix of same pole, next pole over and lateral, small lateral colocation. We try as best we can to force everything into same pole colocation, because that is the best return we can get, it's the least incremental cost from capital going into it. But those returns, I just went through to incorporate all of it., So, we feel really comfortable with what our assumptions are and because they're based on the history we've seen across all of our small cell today., Simon Flannery, Right. We've touched on fiber solutions, you announced Chris Levendos coming in as COO. Some leadership changes there, can you just talk about the business overall, particularly in a COVID environment and what the mission is for Chris as he takes over there?, Dan Schlanger, Yes. So Chris has been a part of Crown Castle for last few years, couple years. His background is firmly in how to build and run fiber businesses for a few companies in his history, and he brings great expertise and very deep knowledge about how to construct, operate and, ultimately, sell fiber networks. And so, we're really excited for him to step into the role bringing all that experience and expertise to bear. His charge is like all of our charge, we want to maximize the return we get on the asset we have. And that asset is a fiber asset that is utilized not only for small cells and the colocation of small cells, but also to deliver access data transport to enterprises, which we would call it the fiber solutions are enterprise business. And we need whatever we do to add as much revenue as we can, with as little cost as possible. And Chris is in charge of trying to figure out how to do that, as we all are, that's our job., In the current environment, we've seen a limited impact from COVID. The biggest market we have for fiber solutions is in the northeast, and the some of the biggest impacts to the way business is being done have been felt in the northeast. And the biggest impact we have seen to our specific fiber solutions business is that it has really elongated the time between having a good dialogue with the customer and closing a deal. So the decision-making process has become much longer in many parts, in many ways, because of having to meet virtually and a sales process is a very close process. And being able to meet in person is really helpful. And we haven't been able to do that nearly as much as we had in the past, which has led to longer cycle times on the sales, which has led to less predictability of when things will happen., It has not impacted our overall growth. The demand is still there, we still think we can grow 3%, both in 2020 and 2021. It has not impacted our overall churn, it still remains in the high-single digit range per year. It just made the business a little bit more challenging to get through on a day-to-day basis both from a sales standpoint, and from an operation standpoint where it is harder to get into buildings to make repairs, it's hard to get into buildings to do installations. And I really commend our teammates who are working out there every day making that happen, because it's got to be a difficult situation. And they're keeping it up to where we're able to maintain our growth rates very consistent with what we would have expected not in COVID., Simon Flannery, Right. Well, a European conference wouldn't be complete without asking you about Europe. So we have seen a remarkable volume of tower unrelated infrastructure deal activity in the market and more to come, I think, but the Crown has been pretty quiet. So help us think about how you're looking at M&A, international opportunities, and what we should expect going forward?, Dan Schlanger, Sure. We always keep apprised of international M&A opportunities, and we're always interested in them, because they might represent very good transactions. It's just, we have not seen recently in Europe, specifically, the returns that would attract our capital. We think the returns in the U.S. are better, and they're better on a risk-adjusted basis for us. They're better absolutely, and on a suggested basis we want to focus on the U.S. because it is the best market in the world for wireless communications infrastructure. As we've talked about in our third quarter call, the U.S. has about 5% of the population of the world. And we're attracting about 20% of the investment for wireless infrastructure. That's just another proof point as to why we believe the U.S. is the best market in the world. And what we've seen in Europe has been prices that are paid that are driving the returns down below what we would be able to generate in the U.S. market. And we don't see why we would go make those choices., If that were to change and somehow the pricing came down and returns went up, we would absolutely consider going into Europe, or other developed markets around the world, but not any emerging markets. That's not something that we have any interest in. But in adult markets, we would consider it, it's just the returns just aren't there to attract capital away from what we already see as really great opportunities in the U.S., Simon Flannery, Great. You had done a lot of fiber deals in a short period of time, you've built a strong position, and they have -- what you want to call it the NFL cities. But, are you done with domestic M&A, we did see inside traded here recently. But do you think you're going to mostly focus on operating the assets you have and maybe some organic build?, Dan Schlanger, We're clearly focused on organically building our business through building fiber and small cells in the markets that we need to build, that we think are really attractive for fiber and small cell. We do not believe on the fiber side, there is a tremendous amount of large scale acquisitions we can do or any large scale acquisitions we can do at this point, which is generally what we said when we completed our most recent large deal in my towers three years ago now. We did not see a lot of remaining large fiber fields that would meet the criteria that we have for fiber, which are high capacity, meaning larger strands of fiber, dense, meaning under a lot of streets already, metro, meaning the top 30 markets in the U.S. If we meet those criteria, they're very interesting to us. If we don't, then those fiber assets aren't that interesting., And at the time, we said we didn't see a lot of them out there, except for potentially some small tuck in acquisitions. That's continuing, we don't see a lot of large scale acquisitions out there. And we don't intend to pursue them, because they don't meet our criteria. And those criteria are built around what is necessary to have small cell demand be satisfied by that higher risk [ph]; and without that, we don't see the value. So we don't see a lot of M&A activity in our future. Again, we'd be interested in tower business in the US. But we do remain disciplined on pricing and want to make sure that we generate good returns from those tower assets, as well., Simon Flannery, Great. Maybe just to wrap up; one of the exciting things about DISH is it's a brand new customer coming in, with its tens of thousands of towers of demand. Where do you see additional opportunities to bring new customers into the industry like cable, to bring new use cases, like edge compute, one of the things that have you most excited over the medium term?, Dan Schlanger, You're moving fast, DISH was announced yesterday, and we're looking for the next thing, we're excited about DISH. First of all, we think it is a great deal for us, and that they will be a new customer that's going to drive incremental demand of our assets. Beyond that, I think you mentioned a few of them, I think that there are cable companies that may be interested in our assets. Other companies may be interested in our assets that they want to build their own enterprise private networks, for their own reasons. And we think 5G helps enable a lot of that, because of the architecture and the cost of building 5G networks, hopefully, coming down. , So we think that there's opportunity out there to expand our customer base, which would ultimately lead to better colocation economics, because it will go to assets we already owned, most likely, and generate really good return for our shareholders, which we think supports our long term 7%, 8% growth rate, our AFFO per share, dividend per share, that we think is really attractive when you look at the underlying business being a stable, and as good as ours is, delivering 7% to 8% growth with 3%, 3.5% dividend. We think it's a remarkably good investment opportunity and something that we're excited about, that we can continue for a long period of time, given all the investments we're making today, and new business in small cells that we think will generate really good returns over the next 5, 10, 20 years., Simon Flannery, Right, well done. That's a great place to stop and we really appreciate your time today. Thanks everybody for joining us, and have a great evening. And we hope to see you in real life next year. Take care., Question-and-Answer Session"

Good morning everyone. I’m David Walker, Head of Investor Relations at British Land, and I’m on the line today with Chris Grigg, Chief Executive; Simon Carter, our CFO; and Darren Richards, our Head of Real Estate., Before I hand you over to Chris, could I just remind those of you joining us by phone that, the slides are available to download now at britishland.com. And you are able to register questions on the conference call at any time from now during the presentation. For those of you listening through the website, slides will appear automatically, and you can submit written questions via the website, which I will read out following our prepared remarks., With that, I will hand you over to Chris., Christopher Grigg, Thank you, David. Good morning, everybody. As you know, for nearly 12-years I’m stepping down as CEO for British Land. It has been an honor to lead this company, to work with so many talented individuals, not least from projects, which have literally changed the face of London., The things we have done to reshape and reposition the business under the course of the decade have also been fundamental to our ability to navigate the impact of COVID-19. There are few key things, I would point to, the quality of our assets, the clarity of our strategy, our focus on operational excellence and the needs of our customers as well as our strong balance sheet., I would like to talk through these points in a bit more detail. First the quality of our asset. We have delivered fantastic buildings including the [indiscernible], 100 Liverpool Street and Clarges. We transformed places like Paddington as you can see here and Broadgate of course. This has created tangible value for our shareholders, as well as delivering real benefits for our customers and communities., But we have done all of this while keeping our financial discipline at significantly reduced leverage to lower in mid twenties in 2018, compared to more than 50% when I joined in 2009 that is why we have been able to absorb value on the retail side of our business. But remember, we also have no requirement refinance until 2024., We have a clear strategy. Our focus on mixed used campuses is a real differentiator, because it presents opportunities overtime. Our product is attractive to customers. The campus is also allow us to change the mix of usage and try to - so we can react to growth. Again, Broadgate is a great example., our operational capabilities are simply best-in-class, from developing world-class buildings and keeping them full, to enhancing our environments through place making. Our ability to manage spaces, safety and security has never been more important., We were among the first in our industry to really focus on the customer and to make data essential to that. Our insights and the relationships we do will be valuable as we navigate the changing dynamics in our markets., And last our culture. This isn’t something we usually talk about in the results presentation, but I absolutely believe its British Land’s real strengths. We are more diverse and inclusive than we were a decade ago. We are innovative and we are flexible. We have a breadth and depth of skill set that goes beyond developing and managing buildings and corporate that is and sustainability in technology in marketing, and of course in finance., And we are truly aligned to our purpose, placing people. The fact that the bullet selected someone from within British Land to succeed has also a strong testament to our culture. Simon was a standout candidate with both an internal and external perspective, both on our business and across the sector. So he offered the right mix of continuity and fresh ideas. I know he is also very clear on the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead., Finally, I would like to say thank you to all of you. It has been a real pleasure working together. I wish all of you the best of luck, and hope to see many of you again in more normal times. I will speak to you in Q&A., But for the last time I will hand over to Simon for the financials., Simon Carter, Thank you, Chris. Good morning, everyone. The rest of the toddy’s presentation are in three parts. Firstly, it won’t be my last job, the CFO, I will take you through the financial. Then down we will talk about our operation performance, putting this in the context of our markets. And then my first job as CEO, I will set out my priorities, which is designed to make the most competitive edge., Before we do any of that, however, I would like to take this opportunity to thank Chris. [indiscernible] for the guidance and support he has provided me for the last 12-years. But most importantly, the great business built under his leadership [indiscernible] British Land team [indiscernible] and best wishes for future., Turning to the results for six months to September, EPS is down to 75%, primarily due to increased provisioning for rental receivables, as well as the impacts of CVAs and admins. Average net intangible asset value, which is $0.10 to £6.93. That is due to a decrease in our portfolio valuation 7% as a result of a 15% decline in retail, and a 3% decline in [indiscernible]., Our financial position remains strong, LTV is 35.7% of just 170 basis points in the half year. have accessed one million [indiscernible] facilities cash, significant covenant headroom and no requirement to refinance until 2024., Following our announcements in October, we intended to receive dividends, [indiscernible] 58.4 based on our new policy we are paying now 80% of underlying EPS. Payment will be made in February 2021., Looking a moment in EPS, customer activity added 0.2 [indiscernible] COVID delayed recognition [indiscernible] has now reached completion. And one Triton square schedule is complete. Pretty efficient [indiscernible] to our committed to development program, we expect this to be completed and committed [indiscernible] annualized EPS, already delivered from our post referendum program., The impacts of COVID-19 has clearly been significant. CBI has now been into retail so in a negative like-for-like of 0.68. Provisions for outstanding rents and service charges and deferrals led to a [indiscernible] reduction in EPS, our set out details of our approach to provisioning later., Finance and administrative cost savings added 0.8. The underlying tax charge reduce EPS by one reflecting the temporary suspension of dividend. This will results in a short and [indiscernible] distributions creating a corporation tax liability equivalent withholding tax on the shortfall., Turning to net rents, let me draw out some key points. Like-for-like decline retail was 10%, a 13 million reduction in rental, six million related to the impact of CVAs and admins with the remaining seven million results declining ERVs, longer void periods and reduced car park income over the closure period. Like-for-like growth in opposite was 4%, driven by letting activity at [indiscernible]., Provisions for outstanding rents and service charge income reduce net rents by 31 million, we provided 30 million again in progress and provisioning incentives increased by two million. Developments contribution over £3 million, while in the practical completion [indiscernible] partially offset by expiries of one broad [indiscernible]., Moving to rent collection, those customers materially impacted by COVID, we make good progress in agreeing pragmatic and equitable solutions for a period of closure. These include monthly payments to partial concessions., None, None, None, Turning to service charges. 22 million is outstanding as at period end of which seven million has been provided. At the moment, we impacted five million end of the year. The rent referrals, which primarily related to the March quarter, 25 million is held as accreting to balance sheet. We have provided 13 million against this, [indiscernible] balance to next five quarters., We agreed five million rent concessions in the period. Under the accounting standards rent concession spread over the term of the lease [indiscernible]. Consequently, the impact of materials., Finally [indiscernible] the following period end, we have collected a further [indiscernible] and 12 million service charges. After taking this into account, we have 60% provided for outstanding rents and 70% to service charges., Slide 9 sets out the income statement. We have covered net rents. It was a 1 million decrease fees and other income. Our consistent focus on cost control resulting further 7% reduction in admin expenses., As we announced in October, in improve visibility on the performance of our portfolio during COVID and satisfy our rate obligations, we are receiving a dividend. Dividends will now be paid semiannually rather than quarterly. Announced at the time by interim results. With payments made to shareholders in February and August., Dividends will be paid a fixed percentage of 80% of underlying earnings per share based on the most recent completed six month period. This policy ensures dividends will automatically flex in line earnings, reflecting the impact of development and completions, acquisition, disposals and trading divisions as they change over time, crucially maximizes our strategic and financial flexibility and take this business., Let’s move to the balance sheet, following the adoption factors new measures of net asset value, we will now use net tangible assets as our primary measure. Further details the new metrics and reconciliations to the older measures are set out in [indiscernible]., The reduction in net tangible assets is driven by reduced property valuation, partially offset by undistributed underline profit and the gain importantly disposals made during the period. Darren will cover valuation into a moment., The strength of our debt metrics continues to be one of our key competitive advantages and here it really benefiting to the worked done in many years. This has been recognized by Fitch to affirm our [indiscernible] rating in August. We have control facilities in cash at one billion. In the last six months, we have been paid 350 million of [indiscernible] extended 650 million., Taking into account to meet the CapEx and future debt maturities, we don’t have to raise any finance until 2024. Our LTV is 35.7% up just 170 basis points since May, as despite the valuation previously seen and this should be more than offset by post period asset sales of 430 million., Financing activity and our use of caps has kept our weighted average interest rate in order 2.5% and delivered five million savings from the period. With [indiscernible] more interest cover covenants, unsecured debt which we need to have a significant headroom and we could withstand [indiscernible] values across the portfolio 42% before taking an investigating action., Our financial resilience is a key in current environment, allowing us to navigate confidently through the uncertainty of COVID whilst many agile to take advantage of opportunities within our portfolio and in the wider market., And on that note I will hand over to Darren who will provide an operational update on our portfolio., Darren Richards, Thanks, Simon and good morning. I’m going to give you an update on valuations these things and our approach to the occupational markets. Starting with valuation. Overall values are 7% in the period, offices have decreased by 3% driven by a yield expansion of eight basis points with ERVs very marginally up., Recent activity and investment markets more than support these values, this includes our own as well as take this morning we announced the sale [indiscernible]. Retail down 15%, reflecting 33 basis point average deal shifts and an ERV decline of 11%., What is interesting here is a divergence in values between shopping centers down 18% and retail parks and 13%. The Parks is more transactional evidence and early signs that a pace of rent declines may be slowing., Overall, however, we expect continued downwards pressure on rents, given the considerable challenges faced by retailers. That is part of the evidence by the number of CVAs and administrations, 16 more of our occupies entered CVA or administration in the half accounting units, only 13 of those closed, but we saw an £11.6 million reduction in annualized rents as a result., Finally the value of Canada Water has decreased by 6%, reflecting a full in value of the existing use, which is predominantly retail and a small increase in forecasted construction costs, which we expect to unwind on the drawdown of the head lease by the end of the year., Let me turn you the office market. Here, the leasing activity covered 130,000 square feet, half of this was long-term leasing and 9% ahead of ERV. Now, obviously we are operating in a very subdued market, but we are encouraged by the conversations we are having at the moment. We are under up from 310,000 square feet and in discussions on the 360,000 square feet something potential, So, even in this environment, we have customers looking through the uncertainty for the past space, this includes story, while leasing activities also resilient, 30,000 square feet, and there is a year and is a good pipeline in negotiation with levels of interest increasing. Occupancy seats just under 80%, following a number of these events. And importantly, rent collection was effectively a 100%., I want to put this activity in the context of the wider London market. As you know, taken up this understandably significantly down, but it is important to recognize the strong cyclical factors at play here. So, short-term decisions on new space, but some occupies this means extending that current terms as we have done in our own portfolio or others in releasing space onto the market, which has driven secondhand availability t its highest levels since 2004 that is 74% of the total., Of course COVID will shift how people think about workspace, the shift that was already underway, and will now evolve multiple meaning the businesses would walk to get the very best on the office space they take to attract and retain talent, to enhance collaboration and culture and to interact with our customers., In addition to increase requirements, the flexibility, technology and sustainability, that is the kind of best-in-class in space and service we will continue to deliver and will be in demand. And yet the supply of quality space is becoming even more constraint. CVRA estimate the amount of new space proposed by 2023 has contracted by 33% since COVID started., This combination of demand for best space and reducing supply to get them to continue to pay in London is why since the crisis began, we responded to a million square feet of RFPs. From this, this is looking for new high-quality space in three to four years time., In the short-term however, we do expect the leasing market to be challenging and this was actually for the entire rental levels. Of course, we might be immune to this, but we will be aided by the strength and diversity of our occupied base., That is demonstrated environment rent collection stops for September at 97%, the high occupancy across our portfolio, including our developments, which apart from which we committed to you today or splitting that., And most importantly, the fact that 82% of those spaces on our campuses, where we can offer customers same controlled environments, public spaces, shops, restaurants, and - people and the flexibility to have space and services with us going forward, that is a real value to occupiers particularly in a post-COVID world., This isn’t something we are doing reactively. This is absolutely central to how we developed this proposition over the years. And why we think we are well placed to outperform over the longer term despite the challenges we face today., So, now let’s look at retail. For reasons you all know, the market continues to be exceptionally tough. In six months, we signed 160,000 square feet of long-term deals on average 80% below ARV, however, we have a large number of deals under offer over 495,000 square feet, that is £9 million of rent., Deals broadly that was reflected in our Sep temporary ARVs. And many of these were being agreed during lockdown, which reflects the nature of our portfolio. The fact that customers want to consolidate or expand with us, but also our approach., We have had a very clear focus on keeping our portfolio full and being pragmatic about rebasing rents where it makes sense to generate more sustainable cash flows, and drive continued operation performance., This is one of the reasons why we have now collected 69% of June quarter rents, and 62% of September. These increases come from wrapping these discussions into wider conversations on weekends and new deals. And leverage is an experienced team use data and relationships to understand and work with our customers., This includes listening first customers want to turn over provisions, every 20% of our retail leases already have a turnover element, normally combined with the base rent. And this is much the same level as it was five years ago., More customers may want to look at this structure going forward. But the point is not a new concept for us. And it is a throughput in sales. The whole set is clearly ahead of benchmark with total 17% rent and sales 14% rent., Today, all our assets are open as our 42% of our stores. That is more than double that in the first lockdown as those retailers providing clicking collector open in addition to essential stores. And this makes a big difference given the fact that nearly half our resellers are well suited to click and collect and which has seen good performance during COVID. In factories second lockdown, we were within 10% of last year sales and open stores are parts. That is not really a surprise., These are open esteems with easy access facilitating admission by shopping. We think the preference of retail POS will endure beyond COVID. They are more flexible and cost effective to reconfigure and cheaper to run operationally. This means they are more affordable and profitable for retailers with lower total occupational cost ratios, which we think are now heading towards sustainable levels of $0.10 to $0.12., And their proximity to main arterial routes means they play an important role in customer fulfillment. As well as clicking connect, they facilitate returns and retailers are increasingly using them to support their logistics networks. Some of the reasons why you are seeing retailers like next gen and M&A publicly talk about the relative strengths of this sub sector., I also what has been more activity in investment market, but has increased appetite for assets potential, but also where values are supported by more sustainable cash flows, underpinning the approach to leasing one set out earlier., I would like to leave you with a couple of case studies which demonstrates our approach as these kinds of assets. Milton Keynes, where we had 50,000 square feet of new deals under offer, including 20,000 square feet, so a well known discount food retailer for new 15-year term at September ERVs and also, with nearly 30,000 square feet of deals under offer for 10-year terms again at ERV, and well this year, we opened a new 60,000 square foot MNS. The majority of the space came back to us through CVAs or administration’s over the past couple of years., Both parts of CVA rebased since peak by over 20%, to the point where we can now transact on multiple lettings. Both will soon be 100% full and both will have average forecast total occupational costs of sub 12%. Two great examples which demonstrate the strength of the assets and our approach to deliver more sustainable rents long-term., Thanks and back over to you Simon., Simon Carter, Thanks Darren. So what is our competitive hedge and how do we make the most of it. Returning to 2018, I’m struck by the strength and depth of expertise right across the business from asset management and property management development finance investment and technology., Best-in-class - rated capability combined with our proven track record relevant [indiscernible] it is a real competitive advantage. And that before factoring our unique mixed use campuses, attractive development pipeline and long-term commitment ESG. It is clear to me when we combined these [indiscernible] we deliver the best buying for our shareholders., Let me give you a few examples. Develop in the last 10-years of its development generated 1.8 billion profit. That is the iconic buildings [indiscernible] and some of the smartest most sustainable space in London. [indiscernible] great examples all skills of work, we acquired in 2013, we invested in public realm, develops new space, added story and capitalize on its outside location, the cafes, bars and restaurants., As a result, as outperform IPD by 100 basis points last five years. And only a few weeks ago, we received planning [indiscernible] adding more potential and optionality. Retail [indiscernible] at the moment, but that is not deep asset management capabilities really comes to perform. As you have heard from Simon, our assets around performing operations, we have collected more rents and others., Our ranging capabilities also enables us to innovate. You have seen that story, when we rapidly build a market leading business in standard [indiscernible]. It was similar causes, which was an opportunistic purchase. And we quickly developed the expertise to deliver super prime residential, which gain is delivered more than 200 million profit, which we now obtain the sale of the opposites in retail., Broad case another example of an innovative and nimble approach. Coming out of the GIC, many of the challenges faced in financial services would adversely impact performance of these assets., But in short space of time, we successfully reposition the counters to attract new type occupy is involved in placing the fiber to the nearby shortage and specifics is a great place between developing high quality sustainable buildings and enhancing public realm. This ability to innovate, we continue to our future success., Another important strategy is the way we work in partnership. The likes of GIC [indiscernible] partnership give us access to new opportunities enhance for service mitigate risk and support investments in our platform. These are the key things that we expand are really well in place to our broader purpose, let this people perform. Among the focus on them, we deliver most value. Building on the [indiscernible] I want to talk about my priorities in business, you can see them on the slide., Realizing the potential of entities, progressing value increases development, addressing the challenges in [indiscernible] I will go through these detail sharping entities. [indiscernible] will remain at the core of what we do. It complements our skills set, it is what our customers and their ability to increase [indiscernible] success is the best fundamental. We seen matters [indiscernible] we will look to gain same elsewhere., Regions places a good example. It is proximity to the knowledge quarter to over 100 academic cultural scientific media localization positions us well the benefit from each [indiscernible] strong demand from [indiscernible] we have amazing opportunity. I have missed this flexible optionality. After liberal means we can change the mix to response the demand through this [indiscernible]., This brings me to a next priority, progressing value and creative development. We have 8 million square foot of opportunities within our portfolio. Options created over the last few years a low cost. The majority are in producing, we can progress them rapidly when it makes sense. This combination of optionality and flexibility is a key. And most are in and around our campuses. So it is another way we further enhance our core business., Importantly, we have building more sustainably than ever before. You remember I said how our 20% to 30% building strategy in May. [indiscernible] by 2020 and to [indiscernible] most. In order to focus the great example of that, we are building [indiscernible] 540 kilograms in [indiscernible] operationally efficient, increasingly that is what our [indiscernible] looking for., It is also fantastically located adjacent [indiscernible] campus, but clearly reflective that shortage time. So it is exactly the sort of space we succeed going forward. And we have further opportunities in our life line., That brings me to kin of the [indiscernible]. Here we were delighted to achieve planning earlier in the year. We expect to drawdown the head rate before Christmas. We have successfully overcome [indiscernible] process and maintain momentum by commencing enabling works to phase one, so market conditions permitting real positions to placed in medical contracts in the spring., We are looking at a range of uses, we are delighted to be in partnership with delivering that engineering and improve works. As you can imagine, given the unique nature of the project, we have been approached by many investors. And when COVID restrictions allow, we would look to capitalize on this by taking opportunity [indiscernible] bringing higher gross margin., Turning now to retail, [indiscernible] very active asset management approaches that I explained. The clear time as we start the capital is well mixed [indiscernible]. With our advertising security and cash flows in the rental space so we are expecting lower rents events where that makes sense. In a low interest rate environment, our underpins values and liquidity positioning us well our plan., We think that continues to start assets and we have been [indiscernible] remains a shift on the years around 9%, that should be attractive in any environment. Just last week, this is the same [indiscernible] another example of innovation I talked about earlier. We will continue to deliver best value to shareholders. Alternative and additional [indiscernible]., It will not worthy in any case but our initiative and testaments is that we will have more health spaces through the Land, which we can convert in the 2.5 million square feet and reduce it to residential and office space., The good example of this is around [indiscernible] 440,000 square feet with which we have similar opportunity. These projects are very early stage and we wouldn’t expect to deliver [indiscernible] some when it is possible but the progress we have made helps to underpin value., Additionally, we will explore logistics opportunities with the regional partner for rents beginning to cross over. [indiscernible] the way we manage our capital and since the start of the pandemic, we have executed more than 450 million retail spaces - and we have progressing opportunity to realize from standalone offices to [indiscernible] will look to maintain this momentum and crystallize that and those who done clear focus in the key [indiscernible] new opportunities and across the market. We will retain our financial strength and the fundamentals for how we run our business because it means we can development at a time of being able to do so., And finally, we will capitalize on reputation partnering with [indiscernible]. Before I wrap up, I would like to say few words on the outlook. No one knows the extension or duration of pandemic. But as we look forward today, our view is that, occupation market for [indiscernible] as you can see, occupied where they can and supply in space is up. So, the market forecast for rents to be down by 5%., The supply of new space lease will remain constraint. That is where we feeling the strongest demand. The increased politicization towards modern type of leases in the space [indiscernible] outcome generated., We expect our portfolio throughout It is encouraging that the investments market seems to be taking [indiscernible] building in changing times within pre-COVID pricing because [indiscernible] and a number of and then environment with more comparing worlds for the Europe is likely to continue., As we feel rents to continue to effecting the further decline of 10% to 15%. Based on recent activity, we think rents will stabilize first on retail properties and then related to shopping centers and we expect this to replicate to the investment market. We are seeing after 5% of these and we think you can long-term liquidity and [indiscernible] and asset values to stabilize., So, let me remind you about [indiscernible] realizing the potential of assets progressing value of [indiscernible] addressing the challenges in retail to increase liquidity are more apt to be smart in our approach to pace delivery needs to be on the table, this is our financial strength are best in class, our ability to innovate and to work in partnership, I need campuses and attractive development commitment., Thank you. We are happy to take any questions., David Walker, Thanks Simon. Before we move on to questions, because we are doing this by conference call on over the web today, can I please just ask a couple of things.

We've got 30 minutes; if anybody would like to ask a question, just type it into the Q&A box at the bottom right, and I'll do my best to filter it in. And -- and with that, Glenn, thanks a ton for joining. We've kind of glibly -- overly glibly referred to this as the vaccine conference because this is the first investor conference after we've had -- you know, what looks to be very constructive news about vaccines and the potential reopening of cultures, economies, societies, etcetera., I think it's fair to say that Booking has been one of the most negatively impacted businesses; talk about how you think about the recovery of bookings, fundamentals and business in the wake of a -- hopefully, some successful vaccine news by deployments. How long do you think it could take for a recovery in online travel to really occur?, Glenn Fogel, No. First, Mark, thanks for inviting me. Thanks for having me. I always like doing this with you, it's always been a real great time together getting information out to investors and Nash [ph], I just -- I just enjoy talking with you. So great first question, of course, because that's what the news everybody is looking at is the incredibly wonderful news coming out of the pharma's about vaccines that are showing incredible effectiveness. And just wonderful; and -- on the other hand, though, it's not exactly a giant surprise as everybody has been talking to that, we probably get some sort of news in the fourth quarter and we've gotten the news now; just as was expected for a very long time. So no big surprise here, and we certainly were putting together our projections to try and understand what the future looks like for us based on all that good news that we all expected to hear, which we have now heard. So it really doesn't change anything, not a lot of changes happened here. We recognized that it's great that there are effective vaccines but we also -- the same thing that people talked about, there would be news that there will be hopefully effective fourth quarter or first quarter news which coupled with -- but it will take a long time to roll the stuff out, and we all know that., And the more we read about these things, about logistical issues that -- to get some of this stuff out, and how fast people will start being inoculated, vaccinated; and what that means. It's not as though there is a light switch around that we just flick a switch, and all of a sudden, we all go back to 2019; that's not the way it's going to be, and we all know that. So, we still believe it's going to take years, not quarters, we've talked about a U-shaped recovery into the fall and winter. Look, we're all hopeful that people will be protected quickly, and we all hope that these -- what are increasing rates of infection peak, it start coming down quickly, we all hope for that too. But everybody should be aware that this is not a ""Okay, we're all back to normal, because that's not what it is."", Mark Mahaney, Thanks for the -- it makes make sense, Glenn. So when you say it could be years, not quarters; as you have to do some planning for your business out of the next couple of years, do you assume that we were covered at 2019 levels by 2022 or 2023? Do you have a specific year in mind? Or if this is something that you just constantly update and revise, and it's just too hard right now to make that kind of call?, Glenn Fogel, Yes, the latter. Look, we've got scenario planning, we have -- if this then that, if this than that. And obviously, we always have to try and plan ahead in terms of what kind of investments to make today for the long run, that's what we're doing. But in terms of trying to come out and pinpoint, ""Okay, we will pass 2019 numbers on this exact day, week, month, even quarter here, no; not going to do that."" What I'll say is that, we are very hopeful that these vaccines will be effective, and will stay effective by the way, let's not forget that part too everyone. We all are thrilled with the effectiveness that has come out of the -- several months of testing right now. We also would be even more thrilled if we find out a year from now that the effectiveness of these vaccines is still up with these numbers that have been published; wouldn't that be wonderful? But nobody knows because we haven't had a year of testing yet, have we of these vaccines; so we'll see. And regardless, we've got to plan for the future and we are doing that., Mark Mahaney, Glenn, just -- the big negative question; do you, at all -- are you at all concerned that there is going to be some -- just, fundamentally permanent, negative, even if we -- even if we have a fully distributed vaccine in the middle of next year and everybody gets vaccinated? Are you concerned that there are going to be some permanently impaired parts of travel; do you think that they're 10 years down the road? Do you think you were just not going to -- what's the risk level that we just don't recover in a meaningful period of time, five to 10 years to 2019 levels? What's that risk like, in your mind?, Glenn Fogel, I think there is a higher probability that certain types of travel that were -- which was done in the past is going to not be done as much. So absolutely, 10 years from now, there is going be more travel than there was in 2019, I have no doubt of that, in 10 years from now. But the question is, though, as a percentage of travel how much business travel, corporate travel; well how -- what share will that be of total travel in the future? And I just looked at myself first, myself; I'm not going to do as many long haul trips that I'm meeting just with one person. I mean, it's just incredible use of -- hard use of time and money. Why would I do that when I can have really good video communication with one person or one company. And I think a lot of other people are thinking about that too in terms of the costs of travel for corporate – corporations; will that be something that people look are going to look at very closely, going to reduce the number of trips and not do as many, certainly there is still going to be corporate travel, it's not going away but I think as a share, it will be lower. Now, what does that do for the economics of travel? Because we know our supplier friends, the airlines and our hotel friends, who are -- who have been able to make a lot of money off the front of the buses, they say, you know, those first-class seats up at the front of the plane, or the very expensive five star hotel rooms, suites and things like that; I think there's going to be a change. And I think that's going to mean that the suppliers could have changed; so that could be -- could be in the long run effective for us because we're more leisure than business. So it could be beneficial in the long run. But again, that's something that I think will happen but not -- not my -- not something I'm really thinking about much right today because today we've got other issues to deal with., Mark Mahaney, Glenn, can you remind us what percentage of your bookings are business? Is it somewhere in that 5% to 15% range that would be self-managed business corporate travel?, Glenn Fogel, So, here is what I can say; I say, first of all, right now, it's pretty small right now; really small right now. But I think you are free more to in the past. And you know, the past -- past, you know, it's really hard to know we have -- we do sell surveys, and stop as a business of appeal and we click this as business or not. And then you say, well, somebody is doing a one night stay in a major Center City type, that's probably business, who they are checking it or not, and we're going around; I'm not going even go back to that number, and I'll tell you why. Because nobody knows what the future is going to be, we really don't; you can look at some of the stuff we said in the past, but nobody knows yet how fast and what level it's going to come back from. And I don't want to -- I want everybody to think real hard about; it's a new world come down the pike. And in terms of modeling this out, I'm not sure if you can depend on whatever was done in the past., Mark Mahaney, Okay. And then I just want to tease out your comment, Glenn, because I think it's really important about the impact on economics. Leisure travel, you know, for most just in the lodging business is -- if I assume the less profitable part of lodgings for the major lodging companies. And so I'm trying to understand what your perspective is on this, is that as corporate travel probably is that front of the bus, it probably gets smaller. Does that -- does that mean you may actually get more leverage with hotel suppliers because you've become more important to their economics because leisure travel is a bigger part of their business?, Glenn Fogel, Could be, could very well be. And as you know, we are -- we've never been big in the -- what is known as the travel manage area; the TMCs, the Amex's of the world, those guys who do that big company, corporate travel, that's not been our area. But if I'm a supplier, and I'm no longer getting that business, I got to be looking around where am I going to get it from? And that's the leisure area. Well, who's got leisure demand? Will we have leisure demand? So you're absolutely right, Mark. I think that could be something that bodes well for us in the long run. But again, that's a long run thing, not today, not tomorrow., The other thing to think about as long we're on how the market is shifting, and I'm going to jump to something little different but I think it's a -- an important thing to factor is, what's going to happen to supply in general? I mean, we have issues of -- issues speaking about, well, some hotels may not be around in the long run, possible; but then you have all the new supply coming in from alternative accommodations. And my thinking is, the more supply is actually going to overpower the overall changes in the market. And that again, bodes well for distributors who've got a lot of demand. If I'm a hotelier, I got to worry now and I got to worry because now my corporate travel is diminished but now I've got to compete a lot more with the alternative accommodations because the whole thing that just happened from the pandemic is, the -- there has been a step function in terms of the number of people who've been exposed to that product, and they're not going to forget about it going forward. So you've got two issues there, which again, positive for a distributor., Mark Mahaney, Okay. Okay, let me go right there then, and this alternative accommodation. So, you -- and I know you've disclosed it, I'm doing this off at the top my head; I think you've said it in Q2, alternative accommodation which were something like 40% of bookings, lodging bookings in Q3, it was more like 30% to 35%, and our estimate was that prior to COVID it was more like 20%. So you've seen this step up, and you're -- you feel like it's a reasonable conclusion that that's probably a structural improvement, we're going to have people just in the future, alternative accommodations is going to be increased as a percentage of the mix for leisure travelers; that's a permanent thing?, Glenn Fogel, So -- yes, so let's go through the numbers a little bit, and then think how things are going to play out. So 40% second quarter, that was the share for the new bookings that were alternative combinations; of course, that means 60% were doing hotels. And then third quarter bookings, they dropped and I think it was about one-third less, it's right in the middle what you were saying there. Now, both those were higher than the year before 2019; so shares were up, in fact, in the third quarter it wasn't that much of an increase in the share, actually it was a couple of points only in the third year -- in the third quarter. But here is the thing; it's -- the second quarter, of course, was where people were booking for the third quarter, and third quarter people are booking for the third quarter; so it all got dumped in the third quarter, the actual stay, and that's what we are looking at. The key thing for me is that once somebody has tried this, you don't forget about it. And yes, maybe you won't use it the next trip but you're certainly maybe going to think about it., And what that does is, it accelerated a trend that had been happening for a long time, which is more and more use of alternative accommodations; there had been a trend. And the pandemic has brought forward that trend, it's brought forward people who may not have thought about this for until next year or the year after; well, now more people are thinking about it. And that is something that of course, as a distributor, and us, who have really the largest of both, hotel and alternative accommodations together, that's a great advantage for us. Because when people come to a site to site Awareness Day, many times they really don't know, they really don't know; we see in the way people come on to our site and go use our app, and they are looking at different stuff, they look at a hotel, then look at a home, then they look at a hotel, then they look at a home, and then they make a decision. So we have a great advantage having all the types of accommodations, one-stop shopping, not having to go from site to site to site, and then make a decision; it really is a much easier way to do things., Mark Mahaney, Okay, let me keep drawing on that. So, if alternative accommodations becomes a bigger part of your business -- well, if it becomes a bigger part of leisure travel, it's beneficial to a distributor like you because you have more inventory, and then maybe you have higher match rates. The unit economics, does that change? Is it more profitable for you to sell alternative accommodation versus the traditional hotel lodging? Is it less profitable?, Glenn Fogel, Well, in the past we've always talked about this. Our alternate accommodation is nicely profitable; that's the past, of course, you know, we're a new world of everything right now. One of the key things is, of course, is not all -- the take rates are generally the same; that's not the issue, the issue is how efficient can you be with a different kind of supply. So there is always a scale issue; so if you're dealing with individual homeowners or something like that, and you're having to set them up, and you're going to have to deal with them, when there is some sort of an issue or customers also higher contact rates on the alternative accommodations than on hotels, those costs can make it generally less profitable than the hotel news. Our job is to begin to make things more efficient, make things smoother, using all the tools that we're creating, to try and bring up the efficiency of all our product. So in the long run, I don't know how it's going to play out if in the long run, people are going to be able to stop asking questions like, well, are there towels at this home? Or do I have to bring my own towels? You think, you know, we can come up with better way of getting that answer so that the person is not actually using up a customer service operators time. So we'll see but I am hopeful that we will continue to improve the profitability of the alternative accommodation., Mark Mahaney, Okay. Okay, let me switch gears. You know, you've had -- unfortunately have some layoffs. I think the first time in Bookings history during this -- during this crisis, I think he announced something like, almost $400 million -- $330 million to $380 million in run rate savings. Booking has always been known for being a highly profitable, highly efficient business model running for years at 40% EBITDA margins, assuming that you're back to 2019 and then higher levels, you know, at some point in the next three to five years; is there a reason to think that Booking comes out of this as an even leaner and meaner business model with higher margins than it was pre-COVID?, Glenn Fogel, Well, first is correct. We -- in Booking Holdings, you know, we have a number of different companies and we have been through layoffs in the past, and I've actually been have participated them in the past, and emotionally it doesn't get any easier, just could you do more of them. And we did it back when the bubble burst in 2000-2001, and we had to do it again, the recession 2003. So we've been through letting people go, we know how tragic that really is; I don't -- I never want to think of that as easy or something that's just as -- you know, it's fine, it's not a big deal. It is a big deal, and we've done it, and it's still hard even now, while we're in the middle of doing this., And you're right, we do want to be efficient, we try and be efficient, we try and maintain good margins. The trend overtime, though, and we talked about this our strategy, building out the connected trip, using payments and elements that the actual operating margin, these different projects, different things we're doing, actually is going to lower the overall average margin, the number, but absolutely, we want to have more margin dollars, we want to grow the bottom line. But as a margin number and the operating margin you're talking about which a lot of people look very closely at, you got to expect there will be pressure overtime as we continue to bring in more lower margin business, flights didn't -- we can make a lot of money on flights, but it can be very important for the connected trip; same thing for a bunch of the other things., So, I think that people have to be cognizant that while we may not have the same high operating margins, we will be having lots of high operating dollars., Mark Mahaney, Okay. Okay, let's stick with the connected trip, then. Glenn, and help me; where do you think Book -- and I know this is almost impossible to answer in this environment? But how far -- how well do you think -- how much of the connected trip do you have connected? Do you feel like you have connected and you'll be able to really show that post-COVID?, Glenn Fogel, Yes. So we're making progress in a lot of different areas and I am very pleased with the progress we've made, even given the incredible difficulties that are going on right now. So the fact that we've got a fight, for example, in the states for booking.com in the middle of all this terrible pandemic; I mean, compliments to the team doing that. The things that we've been doing, ground transportation, for a very long time; great stuff there, bringing amusement as a source for our attraction product, very nice there. And the progress we're making in payments, which is the glue that brings it all together; so we are making progress there. But a lot of the stuff very, very early; people have asked me questions about, so how is the fights going? I'm like we just got it up in the U.S. You know, like, it is not like there is a lot of demand there right now. So it's going to take some time, but I am pleased with the progress being made, and certainly I am going to be even more pleased when I can bring out and show how effective it is in making our customers more loyal, and coming back direct., And on the other side, showing all the merchandising opportunities for our suppliers to be able to bring in different components into the trip that will enable our partners to do even better., Mark Mahaney, Which part, Glenn, of the connected trip -- there is a couple of different elements you've mentioned; you think could be most material to Booking? Could be most material to Booking; is it flights? Is it payments? Is it local activities?, Glenn Fogel, Oh god, I'm so tempted to say, yes. But one thing else, of course, is payments, it's a very important part of it, it -- you know, it's not something where we're going to make money on it upfront, but it's the glue that brings everything else, so you can offer a credit to somebody within the connected trip and make it seamless and frictionless, and easy to any place for any of these things because it's very important part too. Look, it's all important; obviously, one thing that we do like about flights is a lot of people start their trip looking at flights first, so it's a way for us to get in front of that customer right away; good thing there. Of course, ground transportation [ph], we like because we can make some good money on it but even more so, it really provides a differentiator, and we've talked with customers who have been just thrilled when we've offered up to them the exact ground transportation they needed based on the size of their party, where they're going, etcetera, with the trip, and seeing a great price for it because the supplier was willing to give us a reduced price off what they would have offered on the -- to the public, they are giving us a special price because we're bundling it in, we're packaging it in, and using it in a very narrow closed user group focus. So those things are really great., And it's going to take time; look, it's going to take time but I really do believe that the frustration level of travel is still extremely high. And the connected trip is truly one of the ways to help reduce that friction, brings back the loyalty, brings back the direct; and it's one of those things where you hope that the -- you know, the flywheel just grows faster and faster., Mark Mahaney, Okay. Glenn, I wanted to come back to alternative accommodations and we've had a couple of emailed in questions, typed in questions on this too. In the last couple of days, there has been a fair amount of new disclosure on the alternative accommodations market, on the growth of the market, on it's recovery, you know, potential recovery during this pandemic, the resilience of it on the unit economics, and some of that -- some of that new disclosures; anything that you find interesting as it relates to Booking?, Glenn Fogel, No, I haven't looked at those disclosures yet but I certainly will; and, of course, one person's pay or our group people's paying. Look, I think first thing to look at this is, there is no change from last week before new disclosures to this week, in terms of we all know, the trend that I talked about earlier has been going on for a very long time, and people do like the alternative accommodation business. That being said, they also like hotels, and that's why offering both is a great thing. We also know that there is more pressure against the alternative accommodations area coming from the regulatory view -- point of view where many, many popular tourist places are having -- are causing issues, there are issues in these places because the people who live there feel that there are just too many tourists or the tourists are too concentrated, then they've got to be spread out, and -- or they feel that their people aren't paying taxes appropriately, lots of different issues., Look, we want to be a very good corporate citizen in the area of making sure that the alternative accommodation market, which is important for so many stakeholders is built out in the right way. So it's a win-win-win for everybody, and we've always tried to do that, and we're always going to continue to try and do that. But I do believe it will continue to grow, we'll continue to be there, continue to build it out, there are parts of the world where we're better at it than others and we're going to concentrate more on the areas where we perhaps are [indiscernible] next in that area. But I do believe that is a great growth opportunity for us., Mark Mahaney, Super. Here's another great question that came in. Prior to COVID, you talked about trying to get more traffic to the business organically. You had brought to amount of direct traffic to Booking and it's asset is above 50%. Is there a reason do you think that the COVID crisis would have accelerated that shift towards organic traffic booking, accelerated the shift?, Glenn Fogel, I think it's so hard to try and tease out from anything that's going on right now, and use that as a basis for the future. I just wouldn't even go there. I mean, it's just a very strange world we're operating in right now. And I think that the way to think about looking for the future is go pre-COVID for a better sense of what's going to happen in the long run. , And yes, we have our direct and we talk a lot about it, how important it is, we're going to continue to work on that. And because that is a strategic goal for us, to make sure that people come to us direct, because we're offering a better service and that's really the secret sauce to the future., Mark Mahaney, Do you have a stretch goal of what percentage of bookings or traffic you would like to have coming direct? You've announced that a year above 50% for you is wildly successful 55%, 60%, 65% 70%, what's wildly successful to you?, Glenn Fogel, I'm a firm believer that more is better, but there is a peak and what you don't want to do is -- yes, you got a great direct number, but if you're not growing because you're not getting a lot of growth, that's not good. So if there are places you have to go to get that customer to come first, other ways are not direct, but you've got to go get that customer and that's the way to get them to come in and try it at once, and then turn them into a direct down the road; that's fantastic. So, I'm not going to purposely -- well direct is all about select -- hey, let's not do any marketing at all and in that way we'll stick with a much higher direct, that'd be really foolish. So we're going to continue to operate, of course, in all the different channels where we can get customers, we'll always be careful about how much money we're going to spend on it. , And one of the factors that we do look at closely is, does that channel produce customers who then switch over and come direct or do they never come back direct? And that matters in terms of what kind of money you want to spend on that on that channel. , Mark Mahaney, Glenn, I remember we did an investor meeting in the middle of March, really in the teeth of -- the first teeth of the COVID crisis. I remember asking you at the time, what would you be looking for in signs of an eventual recovery? And I think at the time you said, basic search traffic. Is that still what you'll look forward to really see whether at least your travel demand is coming back? Is it already -- is there any sign at all in the last just week and a half that people are starting to -- at least start to search more for leisure travel? , Glenn Fogel, I think what's important is what I said right within our earnings call. And when I said the earnings call was the previous seven days, I gave a number out and -- doesn't forget the actual number -- wasn't good. It was bad. And we see around the world, infection rates are going up, not down. We see around the world, governments are increasing restrictions, not reducing restrictions. So yes, it turns out one of the great ways to try and see what's going on is to follow that search traffic data and see are people begin to look. But also important to look at, another good indicator, what the virus rate infection rate is, that's another good thing to say. But the third thing is, I'd say is, for us, it's important, this is what we're going to spend in marketing all that, because I know you don't want to waste your money. But on the other hand, you want to make sure you get that customer when they're first coming in thinking about travel. That's important for us; that's our role., As an investor, I would think, doesn't really matter, it's a long run than matters, whether booking -- one week, they should have spent more of that week on search or not, it's irrelevant in terms of long run. Much more so, long run is going to produce a better service that's going the long run, bring back more people and keep them coming direct. , Mark Mahaney, Okay, my colleague, Ben Wheeler, wanted to jump in with a question. , Ben Wheeler, Hi, Glen. Thanks. The extent that you think you might have gained any share in the US hotels market over the past quarter or two, how sustainable do you think that those gains are? What gives you confidence that you can maintain a large portion of those gains, as we slowly get back to normalized volumes?, Glenn Fogel, So we talked about how North America was our stronger region, we were very pleased about that. We talked about that in the earnings call. And I am happy about that. And I think it's really keep doing what we've been doing, which is provide a great service, great value, make sure we're offering up the right products that people want to use, that's the way we do it, we just got to keep on doing it. And it's not going to be one of those things where we're going to be able to come fantastic in a quarter or a year, but so that we can keep on pressing, pressing, pressing keep on doing it. And that's the way to do it. I think in the past, part of it was we didn't have as much focus, perhaps, in all the parts of our business. So we've always been a global player, and we scaled our business by trying not to make things so special or localized too much for any one particular area, in the belief that to be a global player, to get up fast, you got to try not to fork the code too much, you got to try not localize too much at first., But I think now, what we need to do is, and we are doing it, is more localization, really, make sure that we are approaching the US market in a way that the US market should be approached and not trying to do just a generic overall the whole world-type thing. I think that is part of -- one way that we're beginning to improve how we're doing things. , Ben Wheeler, And Glenn, one last quick question, and it has to do with regulation in Europe. Any update on the potential outcome -- the potential that Booking would be considered a clinical gatekeeper under European regulatory law? , Glenn Fogel, No. I continue to read the same rumors and leaks that everybody else reads and nobody knows exactly what the new rules will be and what the impacts of them will be. We all recognize that it's going to take some time before anything is actually effective becoming any impact for anybody, and we will continue to come out with the point of view of that, of course, we are not a gatekeeper. But nobody knows, and we'll just have to keep on monitoring and continue to say our story. , Ben Wheeler, Okay, thank you. We're at the end of our time, Glen Fogel, CEO of Booking Group Holdings. Thanks to Tom for joining us. I hope you stay safe. Glen, I hope to see you in person in 2021. , Glenn Fogel, Oh, thank you, Mark. Thank you to everyone. Thank you., Question-and-Answer Session"

Well, welcome everyone. I am Brett Feldman. I'm Goldman Sachs' U.S. telecom, cable, media, and telecom infrastructure analyst. It is my pleasure to be hosting this session at REITworld this morning with Jay Brown, the CEO of Crown Castle. Jay thanks for being with us., Jay Brown, Thanks, Brett. Thanks for having me, Brett Feldman, All right. I do have to quickly read some disclosures and then we're going to get into our Q&A. So we are required to make certain disclosures and public appearances about Goldman Sachs' relationships with companies that we discuss. These disclosures relate to investment banking relationships, compensation received or 1% or more ownership. We're prepared to read aloud disclosures for any issuer upon request. However, these disclosures are available in our most recent reports available to you our clients on our firm's portals. Also, the views stated by non-Goldman Sachs personnel do not necessarily represent those of Goldman Sachs. All right, let's get started., So Jay, Crown Castle is the largest telecom infrastructure provider in the U.S. You're effectively tied with American Tower in terms of the number of towers that you operate, but you are also the largest operator of small cells, and you're one of the largest operators of enterprise fiber in the country as well. And so the first question is why does it make sense for Crown Castle to be diversified across the entire telecom infrastructure stack?, Jay Brown, Yes, the primary reason is that we want to make sure that we're offering a solution to our wireless customers rather than just single products. And we believe that over time, the provision of an entire solution as networks advanced into 5G will be more profitable and create greater returns for our shareholders over the long-term. One of the unique things about that will happen as the world moves into 5G is that fiber increases in its importance as a part of the overall component of wireless networks. And as evidenced by the recent announcement that we made with DISH, it becomes a really important and key component of the overall network., So we'll see carriers deploy as we get even – and as we get into 5G, we'll see them use a macro towers as they have historically. Those towers will provide good overall coverage and the network towers continue to be the lowest cost and most efficient way for the curators to deploy their spectrum and to create coverage in the network. And then they'll also need fiber and small cells both to densify the network as well as to control components of the network as they move towards 5G., So our desire is to be the leading provider of infrastructure in the U.S. and offering that stack puts us in a position to do that. And ultimately, what we think that results in is that results in a longer-term growth rates in dividend per share. Our target is 7% to 8%, growing that dividend over the long-term. And we think this – the offering of full stack of services enables us to accomplish that over the long-term., Brett Feldman, Great. Well, we're going to follow up on a couple of those items as we move through this discussion, but you referenced the announcement with DISH, which I believe was just yesterday. Just for context for those who aren't obsessed with the sector like we are, DISH has agreed to some fairly significant regulatory requirements in exchange for the agreements they reached around the Sprint, T-Mobile deal. And the agreement with you is that they can lease up to 20,000 communication sites as part of the nationwide 5G build-out. Can you help us to understand, how were you able to come these terms with DISH because you are the first major operator to reach an agreement with them? What were you able to offer them that made this their first partnership?, Jay Brown, Yes, well, we're excited to get started for DISH. They're building a nationwide 5G network and as a part of their ability to gain the spectrum that they gained in order to build out that network. They had to agree to some pretty aggressive build-outs with government officials. And those build-out requirements are going to mean great things for our business in particular. And so we're going to work with DISH to help them build out their nationwide network here over the coming years. I think the reason why DISH picked us is because of the conversation we were just having around the full suite of services., And I would point to kind of three things that I think drove their decision. One is the scale of our infrastructure as you let off we're a leader in terms of towers, clear leader in terms of fiber provision and an ability to deliver small cells and really an unmatched ability to deliver for our customers. No one else in the industry has any more close to the kind of scale across all of the product lines. So I think that ultimately carried the day in terms of scale., The location of our assets is heavily urban focused. So they're built out – 70% plus of our towers are in the top 100 markets. And so, I think, the location of the assets lines up nicely with their need. And then, as I mentioned, the ability to provide not just access to towers, but to be able to provide our fiber services in order to handle some of the things that they will need to have in their network from a backhaul standpoint, fiber to the tower standpoint, as well as data center connections and other things that will be core components of their 5G network., I believe no one else could really offer that to them. So I think those are the three primary reasons why they picked us. And I'm really excited about where it positions us. I think they picked us first because it enables – we bring something that others can't. And I think from the way we're positioned long-term, I think, it puts us in a place where we'll win more than our fair share of tower leases as a result of our more fulsome offering., I like the other things that’s important to this, we’ve said this to folks as they’ve sort of pressed into. What do you think it will ultimately mean to us? The vast majority economics of the transaction are really driven by towers. And our business today has got 70% towers and we’ve got 30% fiber in small cells. And, I think, in the immediate term the driver of the economics and value will be on the map for our tower sites and DISH will do everything they can, I believe to get their network deployed on macro towers. And that's really consistent with what we've seen across all of the wireless carriers., If a tower can solve the network challenge and provide coverage and capacity, then the macro site is chosen. But as you get into urban and dense urban areas in the U.S., ultimately the densification that's required really requires small cells in the provision of fiber in order to do it., Brett Feldman, Yes, when I look at that comment in the release about up to 20,000 communication sites if you are familiar with dishes, build out requirements, they have to reach about 70% of the population in a couple of years, I believe they need to deploy 15,000 macro based sites as part of that build out. It would seem like based on the high market density of your footprint and the access up to 20,000 sites, they could probably meet the substantial majority of their initial build out requirements through your infrastructure. Is that sort of how this agreement was contemplated?, Jay Brown, Well, let them speak to their exact build out plans and how they can accomplish what they need to. I think as we look at it we view this as it's a great first step as they have talked about it, it gets them in a position to begin to build out their network. And I think we're well-positioned to capture well more than our fair share of the activity that is to come as they build out that network. I think the term that they used in their press release was that we were the anchor provider. And so, I think, that means as they go out and roll out their network, they're designing their network around our sites as kind of their anchor build anchor provider. And that will be a great thing for us as this network gets deployed and built out over time., Brett Feldman, Okay. Last quick question on this one. I think DISH has publicly said, they're expecting to get radios delivered in significant quantities as we get into the later part of next year. That would imply that this can start making a meaningful contribution to your business probably in 2022. Is that from a timing standpoint, a fair way of thinking around this?, Jay Brown, Yes, they've talked about the fact that radios will be ready, as you said in second half of 2021. So I would expect the activity around installation, et cetera will start second half of 2021. And then depending on their buildout schedule that's when we'll start to see the benefit of the revenues there. And I think that's right. We don't expect to have a meaningful impact in 2021. And we'll just have to see how things go as we get into 2022 and what the timing on their buildout is., Brett Feldman, Well, that's a great transition in talking about next year, because you are unique among the major tower operators. You've already given us your initial outlook for 2021. You provided that with your third quarter report as you typically do. And what was very encouraging about that was that you are actually expecting some degree of acceleration in the organic growth rate of your leasing revenues as we go into next year. And as you just articulated DISH really wouldn't likely be a significant part of that just based on the timing. So what is behind that outlook for an improved leasing environment?, Jay Brown, Yes, you are right. We expect our organic growth rate to move from 5% calendar year 2020 up to 6%, 2021. And that acceleration is being driven by a lot of the activity that's in the market. We've had over the last couple of years some higher churn rates as a result of acquisitions and consolidations that happened years ago. And churn is down, gross activity looks really good. And so that's enabling us to improve and accelerate the revenue growth in the business. And where – as much as revenues, revenue is a good thing and growth in revenue is a good thing. We like to think about the business most of the time down at the dividend level. And our AFFO per share, as we go into 2021, is expected to grow little over 10%, and we raised our dividend 11%. We basically held the payout ratio that we've had for a long period of time, right around to 80% of our AFFO that we pay out in the dividend., What's really interesting about that is that if you go back four years ago was when we made our first large investment into fiber, we've been investing in fiber for about a decade. But the first really large investment was four years ago. And when we made that investment we increased our expected growth rate in dividend per share on an annual basis. We raised it at a 100 basis points. Historically, we had talked about growing the dividend 6% to 7% per year. And we raised that dividend growth rate to 7% to 8%. And since we did the deal our growth rate over those four years, those four dividend raises, is a little over 9%., So one, I think, it's encouraging the acquisition is sort of played out and delivered the value that we had hoped in terms of translating that to the dividend. And then the 11% going into 2021, I think, really speaks to visibility that we have in the business, the positive revenue growth as you were mentioning. And then also the diligence and efficiencies that we're finding around really running the business while I'm being thoughtful about how we manage expenses. And as well, we brought these assets together. We found some places where we think it really makes sense to gain these efficiencies, improve the margins, improve the yields on the assets and ultimately I think that's the path towards long-term value creation, maximizing the revenue at the top line, being efficient through the cost structure and then translating that into dividend growth., Brett Feldman, Great. One of your larger peers, American Tower a few weeks ago, announced a 15-year master lease agreement with T-Mobile as part of that operators’ process of integrating its network with Sprint. You said that you maybe have a different degree of urgency around thinking about updating the nature of your contract with T-Mobile. Could you maybe explain some of the differences here and how you think about the merits of getting to a new master lease agreement with them?, Jay Brown, Sure. Maybe for folks who aren't quite as familiar with this space, obviously T-Mobile bought Sprint recently and a part of the justification for that acquisition that they made were synergies ultimately that they could achieve in the network combined with 5G investment that they're going to make in order to build out a nationwide 5G network. The deal was announced a little over 2.5 years ago. And one of the things that we've told investors over a long period of time is that, if you just step back from ignoring kind of what particular day you're looking at, which is big picture over a decade. We think the net investment and net run rate as a result of the 5G investment that they will do and have committed to do will be greater than the impact of any consolidation churn that they would have as they rationalize the network., So big picture, I think the combination of T-Mobile and Sprint are a positive to us, and I think they're a positive to the overall industry. We have a little over five years remaining on our average lease with T-Mobile, including the leases that were previously signed with Sprint. So there's a long runway of payments, rental payments that are due to us. And then the overlap sites where oftentimes people try to book-end, what's the risk or what's the exposure to the offset, if they were to come out and try to find synergies in the network that represents about 6% roughly of our consolidated revenues., So as a book-end, we think that's possible and that's sort of a book-end of what it could be. And – but we've got a lot of term remaining. And while they'll go through the process of getting those synergies in order to really achieve the synergies, they've got to move all of the subscribers that would be on that Sprint network that they’re churning off. They've got to move all of that – all of those subscribers onto some other form of the network, which results in investment that they need to make on top of the 5G investments. So we'll go through the – as we have a more specific update, obviously we'll provide that to investors. But I think at the moment, the big picture view hasn't changed, we think of the net investment of porting over those subscribers onto their network, as well as building out 5G is a net positive against the potential term that's out there., Brett Feldman, Great. That's a great transition in the 5G. And if you think about it, the 5G era, really kind of officially began just a few weeks ago when Apple launched the first 5G iPhone. And so we get questions quite a bit, and I'm interested in your thinking, how do you think about what the launch of the real 5G cycle means to a tower operator like Crown Castle and not just to your tower business, but to your infrastructure business holistically. And as part of that, what's similar about the way it impacted you – you expect impact you versus 4G, and maybe what's going to be different., Jay Brown, Sure. Well, historically as these networks have more from 1G to 2G, 2G to 3G, 3G to 4G, and now going into 4G to 5G [Technical Difficulty] wireless and new generation services, there have been – there has been more tower revenue produced as a result of that transition. So at 100,000 feet, the 5G is great for our industry. It's great for our business because more equipment will be needed on our infrastructure and that'll lead to additional rent., What's unique about 5G is, as we move from 3G to 4G, obviously the big thing that we got was speed, and we got an ability that – with that speed, we've got an ability to really move multimedia across wireless networks. But the latency in the network still is in 4G world, it’s still slow enough that there are a lot of commercial applications that are not possible to be done there., And I often think about it as kind of a three-legged stool. One of the legs of the stool is kind of a form factor, another leg of the stool is the technology, the innovation component, what could devices do. And then the third leg is the network itself is, is there a provision of the network out there. And when those three things are come together, you have a significant of innovation and that innovation leads to data traffic., And so if you look back historically, you look back at like 2007 when Apple launched their iPhone in the 3G world, the provision of the device, combined with the network led to all kinds of innovation that ultimately increased data traffic. And as I think about where we're headed here into 5G, I think the same thing is going to happen. Things like virtual reality, augmented reality, greater uses of AI, not only at the consumer level, but also at the industrial level that will reduce that – I think large companies will use to reduce costs and other things. So I think that's going to be – there's going to be a whole hotbed of innovation that's going to occur as a result of 5G and that will drive traffic on our network. And that's the biggest driver ultimately for the need for the infrastructure., The other component that's unique, which is, I think unique to our positioning in the market is the necessity of fiber. So 5G has the capability of transmitting data at a sub five milliseconds and basically undetectable to the human eye. The only way that works is to move data at the speed of light. So fiber becomes a critical component of the network. They've got to be able to move the traffic at the speed of light, requiring fiber. And so it's not just macro sites, it's – you've got to have a complete fiber backbone. And one of the things that the carriers are doing as a part of the move to 5G is there's a lot of terms around often referred to as a vRAN or an O-RAN. Sometimes people call it C-RAN and what it in essence allows the carrier to do is optimize their network remotely. And that optimization requires significant fiber connection throughout the network, in order to be able to pull off this sort of next generation of software to find networks. , And what that means for the carriers is that they're able to provide the spectrum and the service to the consumer more cost effectively. And as they provide it more cost-effectively, it frees up dollars for them to invest in network densification and improvement of the network. So, historically I think one of the things that has been true about each of the transitions from 1G all the way up now through 5G is that when the carriers are able to more cost effectively provision the network. It enables them to densify the network, cover more places with more bars in essence, and that inherits to our benefit. So the dollars of savings from the deployment of the network ultimately end up at the infrastructure level, because that's at its core, ultimately how they improve the coverage and capacity and then our experiences as consumers. So that virtuous cycle of lower costs of the carriers, future investment, I think inherits to our benefit., Brett Feldman, Great. Let's talk a little bit more about small cells, which is a component of this fiber strategy. One of the things that's very well known about your tower business is it's a shared infrastructure business. You build a tower once you monetize it with multiple tenants, and you've articulated that the small cell business really follows the same concept, where you get an anchor tenant. You deploy a network of fiber that they need to support their nodes. They're going to pay you recurring fee for each node that they lease. But then that fiber can potentially be made available to other carriers who would need density in the same geography., Recently, you've indicated that there is a slightly increasing mix of the nodes you intend to deploy that are co-locating on top of fiber you've already deployed. And I was hoping you can maybe give us some insights into that. Do you think you were going to continue to see a more balance between the deployment of new fiber and brand new nodes and nodes that are on top of existing fiber? And how does that change to return characteristics of the asset as that mix becomes more balanced?, Jay Brown, Yes, a couple of things in there. I'll try to hit quickly, first around the economics. When we build a tower or acquire a tower, we generally get about a 3% initial yield when we're adding a second tenant or a little less than 10% on the – from a yield standpoint, we add a third tenant. We're north of – we're about 15% plus yield on invested capital., From a small cell standpoint, we add our first – when we put our first tenant on the asset, we're at about a 6% to 7% initial yield. So about double that of macro towers. When we add our second tenant, we're in the 10% to 12% yield on invested capital. So meaningfully above what we would expect from a tower standpoint. And then when we add that third, then we're in the – we're – we come back kind of in that same neighborhood as macro towers and that 15% plus yield on invested capital., So from an economic standpoint, small cells at the unit economic standpoint are actually yields are higher than what we would typically see at macros in the early days. Then as the asset gets to the full maturity of the asset sort of comes in line with macro sites. So the yields are really attractive for those first couple of tenants. And then obviously if we get to the place where our assets are yielding 15%, we're well in excess of the weighted average cost of our capital, and that's a terrific outcome. We underwrite these, assuming that we just get to two tenants is the way that we underwrite the investments that we make in small cells., So we're assuming we start with an anchor. We don't do anything on spec, everything is built for – purpose built for the carrier for that first tenant. So we're always starting out with kind of that 6% to 7% yield. And then we're assuming that we're able to add one more tenant. When we allocate capital towards that end, we have a pretty rigorous and disciplined approach to that. So we go in and look at data traffic in the particular areas where we could potentially build those small cells and build that fiber. And to the extent that we think there's a high likelihood that we'll be able to get at least a second tenant, then we're willing to go put the capital in place. And then look to kind of grow the yields on it by co-location., The last part of your question or comments there around co-location. The last several years we've had co-location activities as a percentage of overall small cells in the kind of 20% to 30% range. And meaning that 70% to 80% of the small cells that we were doing were anchor built small cells that first tenant on the system. So the 6% to 7% yields on invested capital; and then 20% to 30% are the second tenant, that's what it's been historically., As we look at 2021 and give guidance for 2021, we believe based on the activity that we have lined out about 40% of that activity will actually be co-locations on the legacy systems that we've built. So moving to that kind of second tenant or third tenant in those systems. So the returns on capital – on invested capital, we would expect would obviously be much higher as their co-location., So I think that matters for a few reasons, not the least of which is it's a large scale prove out of the business model that small cells is similar to towers that once we build the system, we see co-location and those co-locations come at increasing growth rates, increasing margins, increasing yields on the invested capital. And then it's also important because the amount of capital required comes down. So in addition to guiding people to kind of the co-location numbers that I just spoke about, we also told investors that we expect 2021 to be more capital efficient that our overall capital spend is coming down as a result of those co-locations., As we get off the on-periods of 2021, ultimately it's just going to come down to – are there opportunities for us to invest capital in the top markets in the U.S. that returns that we think are really attractive, putting it through that rigorous analytical process that we have around investing any dollars of capital in the business. If it passes that, then we may be willing to go and build some more anchor systems because of what we think is the future growth, right or we may choose to pass on the opportunity. Because we don't think the returns are appropriate or high enough to justify the investment of the capital. And therefore, the co-location rates would come up. So, we'll give guidance on that as we get further down the road, but that's kind of how it plays – how we would expect it to play itself out., At least over the next – over the next 12 – 12 to 18 months here, as we get into 2021. The higher co-location is really encouraging and underpins the model that small cells are going to act just like towers. And I think a decade from now we'll look back and say, we're so glad that we've made the investments that we've made thus far in these, in these kind of top market., Brett Feldman, Just a little bit of time left. And so I'm going to expand on that, just a little bit. Because of the dynamic, you just articulated higher co-location of small cells, you had pointed out in your guidance for this year that you're going to spend a little bit less capital because you won't need to, because you're leveraging more of the fibers already in the ground., Over the last few years, you've actually been raising some equity to partially fund the ramp up of the fiber business. You're not expecting to issue equity right now, based on this outlook. And so if you continue to see a greater balance between co-location and new deployments and the capital intensity remains moderate that would certainly apply, there could be a tailwind on AFFO per share growth. So is that the right way of thinking about it? You're obviously above the high end of that range and your outlook for this year, what are the puts and takes there?, Jay Brown, Yes. So for 2020 we told investors, this year we didn't think we would need to utilize any equity in order to fund our plan. We've said the same thing about 2021. Our growth rate in adjusted EBITDA is enough to generate between cash flow, the excess cash flow beyond the dividend as well as debt capacity that we're creating from organic growth is enough to fund our need. And so obviously we don't want to issue any shares that we don't have to. So we're carefully managing the balance sheet. We manage the balance sheet based on our investment grade credit rating and, making sure that we're protecting that. And based on the way we think the year will play out, we don't see any need to access the equity markets this year or next year to fund – to fund the plan., There's always a balance in that conversation around, what do we see as the opportunities – as the opportunities to invest in assets. And we certainly want to make sure that we're investing in assets that we think will drive the growth of in the long-term and accomplishing that 7% to 8% long-term growth in dividends per share, that I was speaking to – speaking to earlier, and what's implied in that 7% to 8% growth in dividends per share, sort of a range of outcomes. So we take a range of outcomes on things like interest expense, revenue growth, cost management and other things., And, think over the long-term the likely opportunity that we have to beat that 7% to 8%, probably down to the investment that the carriers ultimately make in 5G. And that could either result in a longer runway of growth, or maybe the opportunity to exceed the exceed the high end. Obviously, as I spoke about earlier, we've been above the high end of kind of our guide for the last four years, benefiting from both interest expense, as well as activity from, the carriers. And we'll see how things play out. Obviously, more is better on that front. And we're really focused on driving the driving that dividend long-term., Brett Feldman, Well, that's a great place to end and we're out of time anyhow. Jay thanks so much for being here with us this morning., Jay Brown, Thanks Brett. Thanks everyone., Brett Feldman, Thank you., Question-and-Answer Session"

23760,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4390069-opko-health-inc-opk-management-presents-jefferies-2020-virtual-london-healthcare-conference,"Jon Cohen - Senior Vice President, OPKO Health; Executive Chairman, BioReference Laboratories, Adam Logal - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Steve Rubin - Executive Vice President, Administration","Maury Raycroft - Jefferies, Maury Raycroft , Hi, everyone. My name is Maury Raycroft and I am one of the Biotech analysts at Jefferies. Thanks for joining us for our London Healthcare Conference. So with great pleasure that I’d like to welcome OPKO and we’ve got a few members from the senior management team from OPKO including Adam Logal, Steve Rubin and Jon Cohen. , So, interesting company that’s become a central player in the COVID diagnostic space and they also have a drug in partnership with Pfizer, which we think could be a large valuable market opportunity that’s moving close to filing for approval. , So, without further ado, I’ll turn it over to the OPKO team to tell you more about the story. Thanks everyone for joining us. , Steve Rubin , Okay. Thank you, Maury. So, hi it’s Steve Rubin. Thank you for joining us. As Maury mentioned, we are a diversified company. We have assets in both our pharma space and in the diagnostic laboratory space. As COVID has been dominating all of our lives now for almost a year, a lot of attention has been given to our laboratory space which has been a leader and an innovator in the space and that’s Jon Cohen leads that effort and I’ll give him most of the time since he is probably more interesting right now, certainly than I am. , But on the pharma side, it is important that it doesn’t get lost. It is a very significant part of our business with significant potential upside. We have marketed pharmaceuticals which is you see is on the left side whereby Rayaldee which is a drug for chronic kidney disease. It’s doing quite well for stage 3 and 4 chronic kidney disease. The growth was getting exciting to us pre-COVID. , Growth has slowed down significantly as patients have stayed at home. Even the number of patients who were adults – are way down, nephrologists weren’t seeing patients. And so, we saw to the net impact. We expect that growth to come back continuing to sell the product and continuing to market the product virtually like every other pharma company out there. , And we expect to see a lot more of that as our partner in Europe Vifor Fresenius has approval in over seven countries expecting to launch that next year and then our partner in Japan JT, Japan Tobacco, which is on our further way to launch. As I’ll go into briefly there, are our expansion studies including one that touches on COVID. , As Maury mentioned, one of the most imminent milestones is our long-acting Growth Hormone. We successfully completed that Phase 3 study. We’ve read that out last year, last October. We have partnered that with Pfizer. , So we ran a worldwide study. We also ran a separate study in Japan and for Europe, we had to do one additional study which you see there, that third bullet, a crossover study which really shows that it has a significant impact on lifestyle. , So really unique to Europe, but you had to show the benefits of a once a week injection versus daily and we show that very successfully. , So, with that and the next slide. So, Somatrogon in quick summary of those that don’t know, it is a once weekly growth hormone. All of the products on the market today are daily products or seven growth hormone products on the market, all daily injections, it’s been that way for 25 years. So we have a once a week and the purpose of our study was to show that is non-inferior and just a safe as what’s currently on the market. , So we actually achieved that. In our case, really the primary endpoint was to measure height velocity after twelve months. We show that our growth velocity was higher in the daily group. And all of our secondary endpoints were also achieved at both six and twelve months of standard deviation, height and height velocity and also showing are safety profiles are similar to the daily. , Same thing in our Japanese study and I already mentioned the crossover study. So, we stratify all the excitement. We expect to file the BLA with the United States this quarter. So, we expect ten months after acceptance of that submission to be on the market in the U.S. if all goes well. And we expect to submit in Europe first quarter of next year, in Japan, first half, later than Europe. , Next slide. So moving now into nephrology and Rayaldee. That is a drug I mentioned for chronic kidney disease. It’s an exciting drug and it’s the only drug in this space, because what it does is, PTH – lowers PTH levels without increasing phosphorous or calcium. , So, they are really been a good way to treat stage 3 and 4 non-dialysis patients with Rayaldee prior to our drug, either they weren’t treated at all or you were treated with a drug using dialysis which are the activated hormones, which tend to actually increase calcium and phosphorous making the drug potentially more dangerous in that treatment at all, because higher PTH levels promote vascular calcification and on lowering the PTH level by increasing their calcification haven’t achieved that even. , Next slide. So, we are also doing a study with our partners in the dialysis market that should open up the market much more to us as - these smaller number of patients, but more focus is getting worldwide to patients on dialysis. , We’ve read our interim data, 44 patients treatment 26 weeks we are showing that even in a stage 5 dialysis, stage 4 lower levels of PTH without increasing serum calcium and phosphorous. We hope to start a more robust Phase 3 – Phase 2/3 early next year., Next slide. As I mentioned before, we are also doing a COVID study. There has been a lot of anecdotal research done on the impact of Rayaldee and whether it has an impact on lessening the severity of COVID, reducing hospitalization. The study was just now authorized in London using an over-the-counter vitamin D. , But our drug need approved in our own studies is more successful than anything over-the-counter to increase - safely increase levels of Vitamin D and you certainly even under these other studies need to have high levels of Vitamin D to have any shock, sudden impact against COVID. So you’ll see this structure of that study. , It’s a 160 patients, non-hospitalized, mild to moderate, randomized in a 1 to 1 basis and observing for 14 days. So we are actively enrolling – at this point, we hope to complete enrollment early next year and it’s a relatively quick study. , Next slide. Real quickly, because I want to turn this over to Jon to talk about our pipeline, we have a series of drugs, pre-clinical that are up we have out there led by probably one of the - our GLP-2 Agonist for short bowel. , We hope to bring that and clear next year and then IGF-1 deficiency is another one we hope to bring into the clinic later in next year. In asthma patients that can’t be treated who have growth hormone issues that cannot be treated with growth hormone replacements as receptors aren’t activated. , So, with that, I am going to turn this over to Jon to give you – bring up to speed on our efforts and how well we’ve been doing in the pie charts to support our physicians out there. Jon? , Jon Cohen, Thanks, Steve. So, let me take you through the high-level on BioReference just to go very quickly. We are running now around 80 sales reps a day, we were at 40,000 pre-COVID. Employees really close to 6,000 in this point. We’ve added almost 3,000 employees since March 13 when COVID hit. Next slide. , And we continue to originally our pre-COVID strategy has been in the target areas for our physicians, strategic partnerships and patient empowerment. , Next slide, and in the physician area, we are a full-service commercial lab serving all 50 states and our areas of concentration continues to be oncology, urology with 4K score and women’s health and then, of course, the fourth is, genetics through GeneDX. , The second vertical is the strategic partnerships. We announced this last year Westchester Medical Center Health System, which is ten hospitals plus where we will be doing the managing the hospital laboratories, doing their reference work and then, moving their employee physician work and others that over to us. , We have some other health systems we are talking to and on the strategic partnership, we have announced some large medical group joint ventures and management structures in addition to our significantly increasing relationship with the kind of care organizations as QNCs, IPOs and several others and then we are going to have a very vigorous prism with this in over 37 states in the country. Next. , The third vertical I mentioned was the – we now have over, well patient access, patients – making the patient experience much better. We currently have over 1 million people who are using our portal and it’s probably over 1.3 million at this point. , We’ve had obviously significantly uptake since COVID-19 where we could get patients their results, we also have had a launch of a direct-to-consumer product which will continue to expand where patients be going online to know their labs directly. , And the third is we are looking at improved ways of significantly improvement in patient experience having their results and actually having their tests access and then the results. Next slide. , The – so let me get to COVID. The update on this, we are running it out of five labs, California, Texas, Maryland, Florida and New Jersey. We are up with some well over 7 million COVID tests that are – could run in the lab today. Our capacity is running – again, our capacity is 70,000, soon to get 100,000. We are running roughly 40,000 to 50,000 a day right now. , Antibodies have been slow for everybody for a variety of reasons. But we will increase the lab based PCR as we move forward within the next several weeks. We’ve had a huge number of partnerships which we’ve announced New York, and Michigan. Florida, we were doing some testing in Texas and I think I mentioned, Michigan and several other cities we have recently announced our partnership – continuing partnership with New York City where we are doing multiple – we are doing at public schools. , We are doing thousands of kids every day and we’ll continue to do that as long as the public schools are open. We’ve done an enormous number – large number of colleges and universities. And then, we are doing much testing for larger employers that what I’ll call large entities, several others which will announce within the next several weeks. , And then, finally, of course, we did the NBA and NHL out of the bubble in Orlando and we’ll continue to do the National Football League all 32 teams at 30 cities, we’ve tested somewhere in the order of close to 700,000 tests for the NFL alone with a remarkably very low – it’s of the novel disease. There is a lot coming on COVID. We are doing pooling as the incidents goes up pooling will fall off some. , We have looked at and validated saliva, although we are not sure what the market demand will or will not be for that. And then, we have – where we’ve announced anyway we will have a home kitting solution available within next – probably several weeks. , In addition, we continue to look at technology as it evolves almost every day in terms of what does point-of-care look like, what does home testing look like, what does antigen look like, et cetera. We have launched a combined COVID Flu IV test. , No one knows what the market will be for that relative to the flu season. It’s – flu season is probably just really beginning to start. Although now it’s been low incidence which has been good for the general public. But more to come on that. , Next slide. Already discussed that and I think that’s where we are relative to just a very high level on COVID. , Adam Logal, Sure. And I’ll just give a brief overview of the financials. So, as we ended September 30, we ended with $36.3 million in cash with another – other cash available to us under line of credit with our Chairman and CEO, $100 million and about $65 million available to us under our J.P. Morgan line of credit with which we’ve got no funds drawn again. , From the third quarter financial performance, we had about $428 million of revenue and compares with the $228 million from the quarter in the prior year, which includes revenue from services at BioReference of $382 million in comparison to $181 million. So, clearly, a very strong financial performance in comparison to prior years as a result of the good work that Jon just walked through relative to COVID. , All of that resulted in us having a net profit of $23.7 million in the third quarter or $0.40 per share compared to a $62 million loss or $0.11 per share in the comparable period last year. , And with that, I’d like to thank everybody and that concludes our presentation. , Maury Raycroft, Great. Thanks everyone. Do you guys have time for few questions?, Jon Cohen, Sure., Adam Logal, Sure. Thanks. , Maury Raycroft, Great. Maybe just starting off with the COVID diagnostic testing. So, there has been a lot of talk about vaccines and those are going to be rolling out over the next couple months. How does your COVID testing strategy change as those vaccines become available? Maybe if you can talk more about that. , Steve Rubin, Sure. So, there are two main areas. Well, first off, we also will have available a quantitative antibody test, which a lot of you folks talk about. I don’t know what the appetite for that will be. Anybody knows or a cluster that’s going to be is that people want to get tested to really measure their antibody levels, so they could decide – how to decide, whether or not they’ll take their vaccine. , And then, they will – people will have their vaccines and then at some point they want to have the antibody levels tested. And then there’ll probably be some studies around that. That’s an unknown factor relative to the vaccine. The other question of course is, the question is how much testing will continue? What’s the vaccine is that for the market? , You’ve probably seen what we’ve seen and it will probably take through June to at least do the first tranche which closely is going to be healthcare workers, first responders and right after that, people at high risk which are probably nursing homes and people with co-morbid conditions. That will take us to the second half of the year, we believe. , And then, the question will be is, how many people will take the vaccine and how many will and the current surveys of course are that about 50% of people think that they all take it. So that’s a question that of course is often here. So having said all that, we continue to see large enteritis, large industries, large employers who are – who have significant interest in continuing and/or actually beginning testing programs. , So, I think that, regardless of what happens with the vaccine, I think we are in for 2021. Beyond that, I can’t predict. , Maury Raycroft, Got it. That was helpful. And then for the serological testing, maybe if you can talk about the – you guys have commented in the past on the PCR supply chain, maybe if you can talk about the serological testing, supply chain and how that works? And potentially, you can - just the margin differences between those two tests. , Steve Rubin, So, about serology, I guess, serology relative to COVID is really – it’s two things. One is antibody testing. It’s really an antibody testing for serology base. The rest of the business of serology base whether or not it’s impacted, we are back to about 90%, I should say, we are high-single-digit off where we were pre-COVID on the rest of the clinical business. , On the genetic business, we are pretty close to where we were pre-COVID. And there are some areas that are above 100% meaning where we are actually doing better than we were pre-COVID. And then there are some areas that have been a little slower to come back. We think that the urology 4K testing should be back by the end of the 4K to – by the end of the fourth quarter relative to where we were pre-COVID. , Maury Raycroft, Okay. And I guess, in respect to COVID testing specifically, if you could talk about just the supply for the antibody tests versus the PCR test? , Jon Cohen, So, the antibody test will be an issue once it’s launched. There is huge capacity to do that. We can do, as we were saying last time probably 400,000 tests they have needed. So there is a large capacity for serology-based antibody testing. , The supply chain on COVID has been relatively stable up until I would say, about four weeks ago. It hasn’t had no impact on us right now as we enter into January there is couple of question marks here and there about the supplies. , But we have not overly worried about it yet. But with the increasing demand for testing relative to what’s going on around the country, some of the other demands I talked about, it could be an issue that haven’t that I’ll flag it as a major issue right now. , Maury Raycroft, Got it. Okay. And for Somatrogon, it sounds like the pediatric filing is on track. But just wondering if you can give an update to investors on where you stand with the adult growth hormone opportunity? The timelines there and maybe talk a little bit about that market opportunity, as well. , Jon Cohen, Sure. So, as you imagine that the filing is on track. We expect – as I mentioned at our earliest call, Pfizer does not announce submissions until they see the FDA acceptance, which is, actually probably in 60 days after actual submission. So, we still are on track for an announcement at the end of this quarter before the end of the year. You don’t – it is still on track to be – it could be submitted at anytime. , Pfizer’s position has historically been to submit that at the time of a pediatric approval that has not formally changed yet. So, the way it should, I think could be submitted is upon approval of the pediatric, hopefully before the year, because there isn’t any more work to do. It will be submitted the date we have along with the pediatric will be submitted to the FDA in accordance with our conversations with the FDA. , Maury Raycroft, Got it. Very helpful. Well, I think we are almost out of time. So, thanks for joining us today. And it was great speaking with you all. , Jon Cohen, Thanks., Adam Logal, Thanks, Maury. , Question-And-Answer Session "

Thank you for joining my first results presentation as Imperial CEO. I'm sorry, we cannot meet in person today, but I very much look forward to doing so in the future. I'm joined today by Oliver Tant, our Chief Financial Officer and Peter Durman, our Investor Relations Director., And before we get started, I suspect some of you might be asking why I took the role and what I think I can bring to Imperial. I've spent the majority of my career in consumer goods. I started in Procter and Gamble, and have had a range of senior sales and marketing and general management roles across a diverse range of consumer facing businesses, Burger King, Unilever, Cadbury, and Bacardi. So I believe I bring many years of sales and marketing experience., And as Imperial's first external CEO, I bring a fresh perspective to test and challenge the business. And I'm determined that we'll deliver our full potential for all our stakeholders. I'm also someone who's passionate about delivery. I firmly believe a commitment is a commitment. And have always been focused on making sure we do our best to deliver against our promises. So that's a bit of background about me and my approach., Now, why did that take the job at Imperial? There were a number of attractions. Firstly, Imperial is a good business with some good assets and people. The problem is, it has been underperforming for several years and having the opportunity to turn that around is very appealing to me. I've also always enjoy being in business and sectors that are going through change. And that is certainly the case for Imperial and Tobacco., My role as CEO at Inchcape allowed me to lead the business through the evolving automotive industry, and to reshape the organization to play to its strengths. My time at Bacardi brings experience of working in the highly regulated spirits industry, where you have to navigate the challenge of marketing products in dark markets as well. I also enjoy being in businesses, which are not the market leaders. And when there is a real opportunity to move the business forward, companies where you often need to work harder and smarter to identify the competitive point of difference and what gives you the right to win., For example, Burger King was a distant number two to McDonald's. And Bacardi, like Imperial was the global number four in its industry. So Imperial has many attractive qualities for me. And from day one, I've been focused on addressing the issues that need to be resolved in order to enable us to deliver a stronger and more consistent performance over time. Today, I will give you my initial observations on the business and outline my timeline for our strategic review. But I want to be clear, while this review is advancing well, this is still work-in-progress, and our plans, the building blocks to create a stronger business are still being finalized., However, I've already identified a number of areas for improvement and changes underway. I will detail some of these areas to you this morning. I will also provide some context for this set of results, including an assessment of the impact of COVID-19 and how is it influencing consumer behavior. I will then touch on our progress in managing our ESG responsibilities, before handing over to Oliver, who will take us through the results himself. I will then share our outlook and priorities for 2021. We'll then conclude as usual with your questions., So let me start with my priorities over my first four months. My first priority has been to visit our markets to learn about the business because of the coronavirus most of these had to be virtual, but I did manage to physically visit all of our most important European markets. Over the past few months, I've met with all 12 of our cluster teams, and all of our major functions hosting around 300 virtual or physical meetings. Wherever I had meetings, I've held online employee channels, which enabled me to reach thousands of employees around the world to hear their views, their challenges, and answer their questions., I also made a point of meeting a range of our stakeholders, consumers, retail partners, competitors and shareholders in order to build a clear view of the business and how are we perceived. I've also been focused on gathering and understanding as much data as I can, a lot of it. It is important we base our decisions on real data and insight., In order to begin addressing the performance and execution issues, I've already implemented monthly business reviews with the divisions and our top five markets, to embed a much more rigorous approach to tracking performance. I'm already instilling a greater sense of discipline in the way we monitor progress, and deliver against our commitments., One of the areas colleagues have raised with me is accountability for delivery. This is one of the key elements I'm now looking to improve as part of the change in the culture at Imperial. And a scene, I will come back to you shortly. I recognize that some areas like culture take time to change. But I'm already seeking to deliver better outcomes by placing a greater emphasis on performance management, and revising incentive structures., One of my biggest focus areas has been leading the complete strategic review of the business with the support of my colleagues. This will continue to be our key focus over the coming months. And as you may have seen in our Trading Update last month, I've been working to strengthen my Executive Team with a number of new senior leaders joining from outside the industry. I believe it is critically important for us to introduce new ways of thinking, particularly given our industry is undergoing such change, with plenty of tobacco expertise in the organization, which is important., But we're now adding to that by bringing in new skills, capabilities and experience developing other consumer goods businesses. For example, Javier Huerta, will bring more than 20 years of experience at Nestle and Unilever at reconfiguring supply chains to adapt to changing consumer needs, and developing new supply chains for new product segments important for addressing our NGP strategy. I worked with Alison at Inchcape, so I've seen firsthand how she can help drive the necessary organizational and cultural change to support our strategic objectives. Murray McGowen is the First Head of Strategy of Imperial with a strategy consultancy background having worked at McKinsey, but as well as with extensive FMCG experience., In a similar way, Therese has taken steps to strengthen our Board, recently appointing two new NEDs who both bring a wealth of international business experience. So, also, I am not yet in a position to fully share all of my thoughts with you today, I would like to take a moment to provide you with some initial observations about the business. I should say at the outset that I recognize the disappointment around performance and valuation. We will address this over time. And my first four months have reinforced my view about the future value creation potential of Imperial., For example, Tobacco is proving its resilience in these uncertain times. And while there always be some regulatory uncertainty, I'm confident that tobacco pricing model is intact and can support increasing returns, going forward. We have a solid business with good brands, high margins, and strong operating cash flow, all of which underpin the opportunity to deliver a stronger and more consistent performance over time. I recognize that there is a debate as to whether these brands are underinvested. But it is also important to recognize that marketing spend in the tobacco sector is relatively low percentage of revenue compared to other consumer sectors. So adjustments to spend are unlikely to be significant over time in the context of our high margins., With exposure to some highly attractive markets, such as the U.S. and Germany, both are large profit pools where consumer affordability is good, which supports future pricing opportunities. I believe that our manufacturing supply chain operations provide us with a really core strengths in the tobacco business. The team has delivered consistently and coped admirably, for example, with the challenges of the coronavirus, with the vast majority of our factories operating throughout with minimal disruption. I also believe they're run relatively efficiently despite the complexity of the business., Our approach to customer engagement is also a real strength. I have spoken personally, many of our customers at length, which has provided real insight. In talking to customers, they really value the insight around the product and support that Imperial brings on areas such as regulation, helping to build solid retail and wholesale relationships. I believe this strength is critical in tobacco, given the role that retailers play in influencing consumer brand and product choices, particularly in dark markets., With Imperial typically being the number two or number three play in that country, I found customers like to partner with us to provide good competitive tension on shelf. I think we can build on the strengths going forward. In the U.S., for example, our sales force coverage varies significantly by state. So there is an opportunity to allocate resources more effectively. Well in Germany, our sales team need to be better aligned to the fastest growing channels and outlets. One of our big German retail customers also comment to me that he has not met with a senior Imperial leader in many years. I'm determined to make sure we stay close to all our customers., This is my DNA, and has critically build a strong and competitive business. I've also been impressed with the commitment and passion of our employees across the business, and also the warm welcome I've received. Our people have done a great job in embracing new ways of working in these uncertain times. For example, our sales force adopted their approach to meet and serve customers. And when I was out with our sales force in Madrid, they described to me how we were the fastest at that outlet coverage to the changes caused by COVID., In general, I found good people on the ground, who we need to empower and give greater accountability. I'd also like to be candid in talking about some of the issues I think we have to address. In Tobacco, the market share performance has been mixed over the last five years, we've often grown share in markets that make a relatively small financial contribution, like Russia or Saudi Arabia, while losing share in some of our larger contributors, such as Germany and UK. We need to deliver a more consistent result particularly in the market that drive our overall financial delivery., This is such a priority. I've already changed the way market share is incentivized in our bonus structure to improve alignment with this objective. It's important to recognize that we operate in competitive market and it will take time to change the share performance. But there is scope to improve our consumer insight to better inform our marketing programs and deliver stronger results. As part of improving performance management in our major markets, we're now reviewing the marketing initiatives in detail against their KPIs, every quarter., With NGP, we're starting with consumer preferences, where it's clear that many adult smokers are choosing reduced risk alternatives to combustible tobaccos. As a consumer goods company, we have an opportunity to meet that consumer demand, and therefore NGP needs to be part of our offer to consumers, where we can make a meaningful contribution to harm reduction. However, it has been challenging with uncertain regulatory backdrop, low barriers to entry and the highly competitive environment. While these factors have played a part, our NGP business has underperformed and our investment decisions have not delivered the anticipated returns., We've already taken steps to address this by cutting investments to reduce the losses, while we assess our assets and capabilities. The NGP team and the markets have raised areas with me where we can improve our execution, for example, by ensuring we develop products that are sufficiently different and thoroughly tested before we scaled them up widely. We will also continue to be more disciplined with our investments in this context. The real positive here in my view is that no company has found the NGP solution that truly meets the needs of adult smokers across the world., So there's more to play for and with a more proven and disciplined business model, I'm confident I can build a stronger NGP business that provides returns to our shareholders. As I mentioned earlier, there's a need to manage performance more closely. I've already begun to make change to lever this through detailed monthly business reviews. This will enable us to be more agile and responsive to changing circumstance and to course correct when investments are not delivering. This must be supported by a more rigorous analysis so that decisions can be informed by consumer insight., I found that we have plenty of detailed brand level market share data that's often not being meaningfully used to drive decision making and planning. All of this needs to be supported with the right culture, with a greater sense of accountability and better ownership of results, all supported with collaborative teamwork. We should be more outward looking, embracing new thinking and learning from others. We must also embed greater discipline around returns that reflect the inherent risk of different business areas. It was often the case that tobacco investments had to pay back within a relatively short period of time, even though their risk profile was well understood and low., However, NGP investments did not face the same returns requirements despite the greater uncertainty. We need to implement a more disciplined return focused framework. I'm also encouraging everyone to have the confidence to be more transparent, and to challenge accepted wisdom, while being much more open in the assessment of performance. I'm determined that our communication should also be balanced and open. We've already taken steps to improve these results - in these results. And we'll strive to do better., In summary, there's so much things that we can achieve and I see Imperial as having great potential. With clearer focus, better execution, we will over time be able to create long term shareholder value. I will be able to share much more of my thinking after concluding a strategic review. As you might expect, I'm looking at all aspects of the business to explore options to create value. I'm approaching this with an open mind, recognizing the current strategy and business model have not been delivering., We need to put the consumer at the center of our thinking and planning, recognizing their freedom of choice. In Tobacco, we're looking at what gives us competitive advantage across our footprint of markets, how brands are perceived by customers and consumers, and what gives us the right to win in the market. I'm looking at the role that NGP can play in terms of providing consumers with reduced risk alternatives to combustible tobacco. I want Imperial to be able to play a meaningful role in harm reduction, which means having a successful NGP business, one that is more focused and better managed., On organization capabilities, as I've said, we're exploring how we strengthen the team and build our capabilities in certain areas, and making sure with the right organization structure to deliver the strategy. Alongside the strategy, we'll need to ensure our capital allocation supports the strategic delivery with the right mix of funding sources, the right investment levels, and the appropriate returns to shareholders. We come out of this process with a clear strategy and priorities that will define what Imperial needs to do in the next couple of years and how we are facing up to the challenges and capitalize on the opportunities ahead., None, So, now let me provide you with my perspective on this year's results. This has been a challenging year, and I recognize these results fall short of original expectations. Encouragingly, consumer demand for tobacco has proved resilient, and we grew net revenue while the business adapted well to a rapidly changing environment caused by the global pandemic. COVID-19 continues to affect and shape all our lives, requiring flexibility and resilience. I've been really impressed with the commitment demonstrated by all our people to keep the business going., Our tobacco volume declined by 2.1%, reflecting some temporary COVID related changes in consumer behavior. We delivered share gains for the Group overall, also, much of the improvement was in low value markets and products, leading to a weaker than expected gross profit contribution. Our profit delivery has also been affected by some additional COVID-19 related costs in manufacturing, as well as some increased provisions following a cautious assessment of further risk, given the ongoing uncertainties., We also had some additional regulator expenses and investments in overheads which weighed on our tobacco profitability, which Oliver will explain in more detail. While the NGP results are disappointing, we've delivered against our revised expectation and is encouraging, we're seeing some sequential improvements in sales progression in the second half. A more disciplined approach has substantially reduced investments, which has supported a significant reduction in losses during the second half. Also somewhat delayed, we've now concluded the sale of the Premium Cigar business, which was a major achievement in the current environment. Proceeds of €1.2 billion will be used to support deleverage., It is clear that COVID has impacted consumer and market dynamics, influencing how and where consumers are purchasing and using our products. With more time spent in the home and restrictions meaning fewer discretionary spending opportunities, it would appear that some consumers allocated a greater percentage of their income to tobacco. This has been reinforced in some markets like the U.S. where consumer wallets were boosted by stimulus payments., From a market and channel perspective, it was clear from the start of the pandemic that travel restrictions would severely limit sales in the duty-free channel in Horeca outlets and in markets which traditionally benefit from seasonal holiday travel. The UK, Germany and France have benefited from the repatriation of some tourist volumes and the reduction in illicit trade. The pandemic has caused some minor disruption to our manufacturing supply chain, resulting in some inefficiencies, which Oliver will talk about. It is clear we will be living with the virus for some time yet. And while I believe our business will be resilient, we're taking a cautious assessment of the potential risks., Finally, I would like to touch on ESG. I firmly believe that effectively managing is ESG response is important to our future success. And also as the pandemic affected some of our plant activities in the year, we'll make further progress against all five of our priority focus areas here. The establishing of an ESG Steering Committee chaired by Thérèse Esperdy and comprising senior figures from around the business, highlights the importance of ESG to the Board, as does the fact we insist our auditors assure our ESG KPIs., If there's one area where it could be stronger, is on the metric for some of the priorities such as climate and energy, we have very robust KPIs, but for some others, we need to do better. That will be changing this fiscal year. The Steering Committee has been working with the business to identify and agree appropriate KPIs for all of our main ESG issues. That work is complete. And once they have been validated against the new strategy, we will make them available to you., I will now hand over to Oliver to take us through the numbers., Oliver Tant, Thanks, Stefan. And good morning, everyone. This has been a difficult year. While our Tobacco revenue was somewhat better than we originally expected, this has not translated into better profits. Our NGP revenue was also fell short of our original expectations. But the steps we've taken to cut costs have significantly reduced the losses in the second half, creating a better platform for the future., In Tobacco, we grew our total market share across our footprint by 50 basis points and delivered further growth in the majority of our priority markets. Much of the gain however, was in lower value markets leading to adverse mix and lower gross profit contribution. Overall, our Tobacco net revenue was up 1.8% benefiting from a strong second half performance in the U.S. and a return to growth in our AAA division,, In NGP, revenue was down 27% as we destocked trade inventories in the first half and as we scaled back investment, particularly in the second half. Profits and EPS reflected NGP losses and a decline in Tobacco profits, which I'll come on to in a moment. EPS declined by 5.6%, more than the decline in operating profit, which reflects the slightly higher tax rate in the year., As previously guided, I expect the upward pressure on our tax rate to continue at around 23% for FY21. Dividend per share of 137.7p was 33% lower, reflecting the Board's decision to replace the dividend, which we announced back in May., Our headline cash conversion of 127% includes a 20% temporary benefit from a change in the timing of excise duty collections. Our underlying cash conversion of 107% was ahead of our expectations, driven by working capital improvements., Tobacco volumes declined by 2.1%, better than the level we've been used to over recent years. In Europe, volumes were down 3.5% with slightly better than expected market size trends, offset by the significant impact of COVID, on our duty-free business. As a reminder, our global duty-free business is all reported within our Europe division. We've also seen a benefit to market size from border closures, particularly in Europe, where a reduction in the level of illicit product has supported duty paid volumes in markets like the UK., In the Americas division, our volumes declined 3.3%. Within the U.S. market specifically, we saw a decline of 2.5% compared to a market size decline of 1.8%. Adjusting for the year-on-year impact of inventory movements in the U.S. of 700 million sticks, our volumes outperformed the market, reflecting 10 basis points of market share gain. Volumes in the AAA division grew 0.4%, reflecting stronger sales performance in the Middle East and Africa, which more than offset weaker volumes in Australia., Stefan mentioned there have been winners and losers as a result of COVID. For example, Spain and the Canaries and the duty-free channel have suffered whereas markets in Northern Europe and the U.S. have benefited. Coronavirus is clearly on the rise again, creating further uncertainty about how consumer behavior and channel shifts may develop going forward. I'll talk about how we've chosen to provide for this risk shortly., As I mentioned earlier, Group share was up 50 basis points and although we grew in seven of our 10 priority markets, including the U.S., we've continued to lose share in the UK and Germany. Our position is however improving in the UK with sequential growth supported by the launch of Lambert & Butler fine cut tobacco together with several large value offerings across a number of our cigarette brands., In Germany, we are continuing to reshape our portfolio led by JPS and West, with a focus on value formats in both fine cut and cigarettes. This has delivered a better second half, but we're still down for the year as a whole., In Spain and France, we delivered share gains for the first time in many years, with gains in blond now offsetting the drag from dark formats. Our share in Italy came under pressure as we increase prices on JPS ahead of our peers. In the U.S., cigarette share was up for the second year. This was primarily driven by continued success with Sonoma and deep discount, while Winston and Kool maintained their position in the declining premium segment., Mass market cigars gained 70 basis points led by backwards. Overall market size decreased by 4.3%, with some stronger performance in H2, such as the UK and U.S. offset by accelerated declines in markets such as Australia and Spain., Overall net revenue grew by 0.8% at constant currency. We grew Tobacco net revenue by 1.8% supported by the lower rate of volume decline. Price mix of 3.9% was weaker than normal, reflecting adverse market and product mix, which I will come to in a moment. Our NGP revenues declined 27% driven by destocking of the supply chain and lower investment levels., If we look at price mix in Tobacco in more detail, we've seen a pretty consistent level of gross pricing across the year, as the whole list is shown here. Overall price mix was held back by negative market and portfolio mix, particularly in the first half. Market mix has been a story of two halves with stronger sales in lower value markets such as the Middle East and weaker sales in Australia creating a drag during H1. A stronger mix of market volumes in the second half was driven by increasing sales in higher value markets in Northern Europe, and stronger volumes in the U.S. offsetting the impact of adverse market mix in AAA., Adverse product mix was driven by a stronger performance from our lower priced formats in the UK, Australia and Germany, with the private label brands in the latter adding over a billion sticks to our volumes but with very little revenue. The improvement in product mix in H2 was driven by the turnaround in backward sales, which were up over 30% in the second half., Looking at the divisional performances in more detail, our Tobacco net revenue improved in the second half across all divisions except Europe, which was impacted by reduced sales in global duty free. Tobacco net revenue in the Americas grew 1.9% benefiting from the robust market volumes, continued strong pricing and further share gains in both cigarettes and cigars., In AAA net revenue grew by 5% against a weak comparator with strong volume performances in the Middle East and Africa and an improved pricing environment in Russia. We also benefited from greater stock profits in Australia, which as you'll recall, is a carryover from 2019. Looking into 2021, we expect that this will be a headwind of around £15 million to revenue and profits year-on-year., Our NGP revenue performance has been affected by the reduced investment levels in H2 and first half trade destocking. Encouragingly, following the destock, we've seen revenue improve sequentially in the second half in both Europe and the U.S., with actual consumer off take remaining broadly stable. In AAA, the second half decline reflects a pause in our expansion of Pulze and blu in Japan, the former pending our assessment of the heated tobacco category as part of the strategic review., Adjusted operating profit was down 4.8% at constant currency. We've restated the prior comparator by £10 million to strip out the benefit of our Auxly revaluation last year. This is as a result of changes to our adjusted performance measures we announced last year. Tobacco profits were £118 million lower. I will provide further detail on the drivers of this decline on the next slide., Our NGP losses increased by £84 million, driven primarily by, inventory write-downs which more than offset the benefits in underlying profitability from cost and investment reductions. Our Tobacco profits were impacted by four main drivers. Despite strong pricing across the year, price mix was below par affected by the negative product and market mix, I referred to earlier. I estimate the adverse mix represented about a £50 million drag on profit, COVID-related costs of £90 million include around £25 million of manufacturing inefficiencies as a result of disruption to our normal working practices. We expect that many of these manufacturing cost increases will continue into FY21. We've also taken provisions of around £65 million against potential stock and debtor risks relating to COVID-19. For example, in the case of stock this relates to certain SKUs, where we are experiencing much lower levels of consumer off take, and so stock durations have increased dramatically, for example, with duty free., As regards these risks, we have deliberately adopted a more cautious approach against a rapidly evolving environment. Regulation costs were around £50 million higher than usual, driven by the implementation of track and trace as part of a EUTPD II and inventory write-downs following the menthol ban in Europe., We also had some industry fines relating to competition authority cases in the Netherlands and Ukraine, which we are appealing. We expect about £20 million of regulation costs will continue next year, relating mainly to track and trace. Tobacco overheads were also higher as we allocated more investment towards the tobacco sales force. In NGP, we had a further £29 million of write-downs in the second half, bringing the total for the year to £124 million. These additional write-downs also relate to slow moving inventory and IP., We significantly reduced operating losses in the second half as we cut costs, reduced investment and renegotiated trade margins with retailers. Cash conversion benefited from a 20% temporary benefit to our working capital from the timing of duty payments in the UK on Logista. Excluding this benefit, which we expect to unwind in 2021, underlying cash conversion of 107%, was driven by working capital improvements and lower CapEx., As a reminder, we benefit from a daily cash pooling arrangement with Logista. Over the year, the daily average cash balance under the Logista cash pooling arrangement was £1.9 billion, with movements varying from a high of £3.9 billion to a low of £0.5 billion. At the year end, the loan position was £2.4 billion., Our reported net debt-to-EBITDA including temporary benefits from the timing payments was 2.7 times. Excluding this benefit underlying gearing was 2.9 times. Including the proceeds from the premium cigar sale, which completed post the year end our pro forma net debt-to-EBITDA is closer to 2.7 times., As a reminder, the sale of Premium Cigars will dilute next year's EPS by around 3% as detailed in a slide in the appendices where you will also find guidance on a range of finance items for the coming year., I would now like to hand back to Stefan., Stefan Bomhard, Thank you, Oliver. So as we now look forward, I'm expecting a stronger operational and financial performance in 2021. On an organic basis, excluding the impact of the Premium Cigar sale, we expect to deliver a low to mid single-digit growth in adjusted operating profit at constant currency., We're conscious that COVID continues to impose restriction across our markets and against this uncertainty we've been deliberately cautious in forecasting for the year ahead. Underlying tobacco pricing is expected to remain strong. Also ongoing mix headwinds are likely to persist, coupled with lower level of stock profits from Australia and the UK. We expect tobacco consumption will trend back to more normalized levels, particularly as the benefit of fiscal stimulus reduces and potential recessionary pressures takes effect., Given the outlook for travel, we're not assuming any recovery in our duty-free business this year. We also expect the COVID-19 restrictions will cause further manufacturing inefficiencies in the coming year. And similarly, the regular costs related to track and trace will continue. We expect the NGP losses will continue but at the moderated level achieved in the second half. A high tax rate will have a 2% impact on earnings with constant currency earnings per share, expected to be slightly ahead of the prior year., Turning to my priorities for the coming year, they are about three things, the right strategy, the right team, and the right performance. My immediate priority is to complete the strategic review and implement the right strategy to unlock the Group's full potential overtime. I look forward to providing more details in January. It is also about the right people by combining the strengths of our existing people with the fresh perspective of new hires. The people in the business have impressed me and this reinforces my confidence., Recognizing that many are watching today, I would like to thank you for your support so far. It is also about the right performance. I'm already taking steps to improve accountability to strengthen performance with more rigorous data led oversight. I'm confident that with a more disciplined focus on execution, we can begin to deliver better and more consistent results. I'm excited about the future and truly believe that over time, we will deliver a stronger performance and unlock long term value for shareholders., Thank you very much for listening today. I would now like to take questions. I'll hand you back to the operator to start the Q&A session., Question-and-Answer Session"

I'm delighted to be joined for a fireside chat today by Mike Gorenstein, the Executive Chairman and Former CEO of Cronos. And so Cronos very quickly, a global cannabinoid company committed to disruptive IP and with international production and distribution across five continents. It's also the second largest Canadian LP by market cap, and relatively unique amongst Canadian names in that it is very well capitalized with over $1 billion in cash and this coming from a sizable investment and from Altria at one of our tobacco coverage names. And so with that I'll hand over, I mean just to introduce yourself Mike and maybe kind of give a quick intro and then we'll follow with the questions., Mike Gorenstein, Sure, thanks and thanks for having me in Cronos. Yeah, just by way of background, I was the - I kind of started Cronos as the CEO for about five years now. I can't tell about the year or 20 years, get based off the pace. About two months ago I transitioned to Executive Chairman. We brought in Kurt Schmidt as the new CEO, and I think he summed up what our goals are. We're really focused on disruptive technology in building, strong brand. And we think that starts off having something that's more than just fluff and given the nascent state of the industry and how much opportunity there is for innovation and I think that's where it starts and we'll transition over to the - that's how you build a moat with the consumer., Question-and-Answer Session"

I have attended as a participant as a -- in the audience for 20, 20-plus conferences and you guys do a great job. So, thanks for -- thanks very much for inviting me., I've got a couple of slides. These are mainly just to drive some Q&A afterwards. But as Dave mentioned, I -- one of the divisions I manage is the corporate development division. And we're doing some really exciting things that are going to give us a competitive advantage as we see the other side of this crisis. And so let me share a couple of slides and we'll jump into Q&A. Okay. Sharing slides. How's that?, David Vernon, Looks good., Michael Leskinen, Very good. So, big picture, corporate development, we were spending a ton of time. The focus is how do we make sure that United is more competitive on the other side of the crisis. And one of the biggest advantages we have is our Star Alliance partners. We've got the best partners around the world and we'll talk about that shortly about the revenue and the connectivity that we get out of the Star Alliance. And so we start with a foundation of strength, and the question is how do we make sure that those partnerships are more resilient than ever on the other side of the crisis., We've been spending a lot of time on that, a lot of time in Latin America, which has been messy. And a second area we're even spending a lot of time and is going to fundamentally have an impact on how we recover from this crisis domestically is the regional carriers and how we interact with our regional partners. And we've had a fairly complex strategy over the years and we're working hard to simplify that and align our interests among the likes of SkyWest and Mesa and Wisconsin Air, et cetera. So, we can talk about that a little bit., One area that I'm really excited about that we have spent -- got a subgroup spending a lot of time on is becoming really important to some of our corporate customers, particularly in Europe that is decarbonization of the airline and how do we make sure that our carbon footprint is reduced. Right now, we have a goal to reduce that to 50% of our -- 50% of the prior level. And so we'll talk about some of our -- some of the exciting ideas we're doing there and we need to do it in a cost-efficient way., And we'll talk a little bit about pilot pipeline not really an issue right now, but as the industry recovers making sure that we have the best pilots and we have a commitment to safety and a pipeline to train up the best pilots in the industry something that we think we've already built a competitive advantage here at United on doing., And then lastly, on this initial slide, I want to just touch on in a crisis like this, you get kind of repurposed to do what is needed. And I was really excited to spend a lot of time on MileagePlus., When I was an analyst and portfolio manager on Wall Street, I always thought about the resiliency of the cash flows from our loyalty program and how as an airline, we never really got credit for that. And there were talks of spin-offs and lots of failed spin-offs over the years and other ways to monetize that asset., And I think all of them fell flat because they created conflicts of interest between loyalty -- the equity holders in the loyalty program and the equity holders in the airline. And so what we did was a really innovative transaction, first of its kind, to monetize the asset through the use of debt, keeping interests aligned for the equity holders. And I think something that was so successful that we saw many of our competitors already copy., And I think that's fantastic news for United Airlines. It's fantastic news for the industry in that this will be a permanent source of financing for the foreseeable future. So, really excited about what we're doing in corporate development. Crisis creates opportunity, and we're trying to make sure to emerge on the other side of this, a stronger United Airlines., I'll touch briefly on what I said on the Star Alliance partners. And I think this doesn't get a lot of credit in an environment where international revenues are depressed. And international revenues are depressed more than domestic and business revenues are depressed more than leisure revenues, to which, I say, that's true. There's no question about it., And what that means, though, is that despite those headwinds, United has performed very admirably through the crisis. And if you think about the world in the lens of normalized earnings, which was the protagonist used as an investor, we have the most upside potential as international demand rebounds and business demand rebounds. And so, we're really excited about that., And we're really confident that international and business demand will rebound, and it's just a matter of getting the vaccines that we know are even more effective than we – than anybody hoped to 90% with Pfizer and 94.5% with Moderna. Really, nobody was expecting that type of efficacy. And so, hopefully, that pulls forward how quickly the vaccines can get disseminated and we can start a drive in international business travel again., But just a little refresher on Star Alliance. And I think I never spend enough time on this as an analyst. But far and away, the strongest alliance in the world, number one by revenues, number one by country served, number one by airport served, and number one by daily seats. And really, nobody is close., And so, what we need to work towards and what my team is spending a lot of time thinking about is how do we make sure that we keep the members that we have and how do we strengthen those partnerships, having strengthened them in a way that we further create connectivity between ourselves and ANA, between ourselves and Air Canada and Lufthansa. How do we make sure that the customer experience is as seamless as possible? How do we make sure that the frequent-flyer programs are lined up with one another?, And so, we've got some really good ideas on that front, even how do we make sure that for the customers that care about things like decarbonization, how do we make sure that we're laying on initiatives like that. And so, spend a lot of time on this and it's an exciting time to explore ways to kind of reset some of these relationships with the current pandemic., This slide really just teasing some of the ideas that we have in decarbonization, and we announced last fall, that we're going to start to invest. We had targeted back then that we would invest $40 million per year in decarbonization and environmental investments around the world. And right now to make big investments is something that -- capital is very dear., But we are -- we do know now that post the MileagePlus transaction post our recent WTC, one of the most creative WTCs in the history of the airline industry that we're not questioning the survival of United Airlines. There's -- we have built a foundation, and there's no question regardless of the timing of a vaccine and the return of demand that United is here to stay. And the question is, how do we maximize the earnings potential on the other side of this crisis., And one of the ways we expect to do that and then be customer-friendly and corporate-friendly in the decarbonization world is to make sure that we are offering our customers the most environmentally friendly options to fly on United Airlines. And so, I think we've got a lot of aerospace investors on this call. Flying an airline, flying an aircraft, the energy it requires for an aircraft, it's incredibly energy-dense., And so, when we think about battery technology, it worked great for Tesla. It might work great for shipping on the ground. For an aircraft the technology with current battery technology is decades if not further out. And so, we're of the belief that jet fuel is the solution for the foreseeable future. And we'll try to get more and more efficient jet engines for sure and we'll work with Boeing and Airbus to do that., But we think that a -- that combined with a direct air capture and carbon sequestration initiative could get us to -- could help us reduce our carbon footprint and meet the targets that we've already set and hopefully over time set even more aggressive targets for the company, but really excited about this carbon sequestration being a big part of the solution and a direct solution that impacts the carbon footprint of air travel versus just buying offsets. So excited about that and if there are questions we can dig into that a little bit more., I'll just briefly touch on this. But prior to the crisis, we were looking at an industry that used to create most of its pilots through the military. And the military created a lot of pilots. And when they retired from the military they often came to United Airlines and Delta Airlines and American Airlines. But with the shrinking pilots in military there's a real shortage., And that shortage is probably now five years out not two years or three years out. But retaining, attracting the best talent at United Airlines is really something we're focused on now. It takes five years to train up the pilot. So if you think the industry is going to be recovered by 2025 and we passionately think it will be recovered before that. We need to start to think about how to attract those pilots of the future today., And so just last year we acquired a flight training school in Phoenix, Arizona and we'll start to run pilots through our training program. And once we run them through our program, we'll run them through a partner Part 135 carriers, which is small package delivery and we'll run them through then our express carriers through the Air Wisconsins’ and Mesas’ of the world and eventually to bring them to United Airlines. And so really excited about this, I think it will be a competitive advantage as I said in driving some of the best and brightest pilots and retain them at United Airlines., So with that Dave, I would love to take questions and we can take questions about corporate development initiatives, we can take questions about United broadly, but excited to be here today. , Question-and-Answer Session"
23733,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4389855-fortum-oyj-fojcf-ceo-markus-rauramo-on-q3-2020-results-earnings-call-transcript,"Ingela Ulfves - VP of IR & Financial Communications, Markus Rauramo - CEO, Timo Karttinen - Acting CFO, Måns Holmberg - Manager of IR & Financial Communications","Pasi Väisänen - Nordea, Artem Beletski - SEB, Sam Arie - UBS, Iiris Theman - Carnegie, Piotr Dzieciolowski - Citi, Ingela Ulfves, Good morning, everyone. My name is Ingela Ulfves. And on behalf of our IR team, I welcome you all to Fortum's Webcasted News Conference on our Third Quarter Results. Due to the COVID situation, we are wearing face masks today based on our internal instructions. This event is being recorded, and we will publish a replay of the presentations after the webcast., With me here today are our CEO, Markus Rauramo and our acting CFO, Timo Karttinen, who will present Fortum's Q3 figures and the group's performance. After the presentations, we will open up for questions. This time, we have a different solution for the Q&A session as we are using teams now. And without further delay, I hand over to Markus to start, okay., Markus Rauramo, Okay. Thank you very much, Ingela. And welcome also on my behalf to this interim report webcast. The third quarter at Fortum was characterized by continued uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. After a quieter summer, the second wave of the pandemic spread through our operating countries and requires continued perseverance from all of us., It is already clear that the whole year will be impacted by COVID-19. Although there has been recovery in commodity prices and certain economic indicators, the global GDP this year will decline, and it is still unclear what the duration of the pandemic and final impacts on the economy will be. This is a clearly disruptive situation. And as an international company, Fortum is by no means immune. However, so far, we have managed well and had adverse effects mainly only in Russia. And I want to say thanks to all of our employees who have been extremely dedicated and have done a great job during this difficult year. I am proud that we, for example, managed to run the large annual maintenances across our sites, given an example from Loviisa nuclear power plant, which was done safely and in a timely manner., During the overhaul in Loviisa, we had more than 1,000 external workers on-site and had a multitude of special arrangements in place to secure everyone's safety. Elsewhere in the company, all whose, job description allows, are working from home, and we are putting efforts into ensuring everybody is well-being, for example, deploying new tools and developing our leadership practices to fit the new situation in line with our open leadership principles. During late summer and fall, we have been working hard on Fortum Group's new strategy and on identifying and detailing our cooperation opportunities and benefits with Uniper., I'm very pleased to say that we have been able to progress in the alignment to be well positioned to drive forward the European energy transition in the coming years. As listed companies, both naturally evaluate the elements of the joint strategic direction and cooperation opportunities in their own governing bodies, ensuring that they are in the interest of the respective company and all its shareholders and stakeholders. With that being said, I look forward to presenting the new strategy and targets for the whole group at our Capital Market Day on December 3, together with Timo Karttinen and Andreas Schierenbeck, Uniper's CEO, who will discuss Uniper's strategy in the context of the Fortum Group, being one of its 5 segments., Now I'll move forward and talk about our performance in the third quarter, which typically is the worst quarter for Fortum and seasonally weak also for Uniper. The year so far has been characterized by high hydrology and low Nordic power prices and the third quarter was no exception to that. The Nordic hydro reservoirs hovered around historically high levels and especially, the Nordic system price and Norwegian area prices were very low. In the Finnish and Swedish areas, prices declined clearly less, which is good, since they are the most significant for us. The strong CO2 price support the Central European power prices and the spread between the German and Nordic prices remained wide. I already spoke about the impact on the pandemic on our operations. Out of Fortum's businesses, only our Russian operations continued to experience some adverse effects from lower power and heat demand., In the third quarter, our comparable operating profit was negative due to the negative results in our Uniper segment. The reason for Uniper's negative results was seasonality and a shift in profits between Q1 and Q3 this year. This is something we highlighted already in the previous quarters. So this was quite expected. It is also good to note that Uniper kept their full year guidance unchanged. So we expect Uniper's fourth quarter profit to be good. Nevertheless, Fortum's earnings per share for the third quarter were still positive at €0.23, as the negative results of the Uniper segment were offset by the tax-exempt capital gain from the sale of the Järvenpää district heating business, in August of this year. This type of portfolio optimization is a mainstay at Fortum, and we are also proceeding with the strategic reviews of our Polish, Baltic and Swedish district heating businesses as planned. In all these cases, we are reviewing all alternatives, including possible divestments., Going forward, we will continue to put focus on our balance sheet and securing our overall financial strength. Equally, maintaining a credit rating of at least BBB flat, continues to be a priority. Finally, I'm very happy to say that our last 12-month net profit was €1.8 billion, and that translates to an EPS of €2.03. Then I'll move over to the operating environment and make a few comments about that. If we look at the power demand, we can see that the demand recovered to 2019 levels in many areas in Q3, Nordics actually have been stable throughout the full year 2020. Central Western Europe, including Germany and France, were weaker in the second quarter. Demand in Russia has continued softer and was standing at minus 4% year-on-year in the third quarter. But overall, good recovery and, in the Nordics, stable throughout the year., This year, we have been talking a lot about hydrology, which has been somewhat exceptional in all quarters. If you look at this picture and follow the dotted red line against the average, which is the gray dotted line, you can see that year started with very high reservoir levels. This continued in Q1, part of Q2. But then during Q2, the reservoirs came clearly lower than the historical average. But towards the end of the quarter, again, the reservoirs were above. In Q3, reservoir levels started at 9-terawatt hours above the historical average and ended at 13-terawatt hours above historical averages. And now we are even slightly higher entering the winter season., Looking at the commodities. Coal started the year weak. The softness continued in the second quarter, but now in third quarter, there has been recovery back to the levels that we saw in the beginning of the year at $60 per ton. In gas, on the back of strong supply, mild winter, we saw a big drop in the first quarter. Gas prices stabilizing in the second quarter. And then recovery in the third quarter on the back of the improved supply-demand balance and sufficient storage capacities in different areas., Looking at CO2. CO2 was softer in the beginning of the year, partly on the back of the strong coal-to-gas switch on the back of lower gas prices. We saw a sharp recovery after the initial hit also caused by the corona pandemic, strong recovery in the second quarter. And in the third quarter, the sentiment in CO2 has been very strong, also on the back of the tighter EU emission targets proposed by the EU Commission, and we even saw CO2 hitting historical highs at €30.5., If we then look at how this all has translated into Nordic power prices, if you look at the beginning of the year, the combination of strong hydrology, mild winter, this all pushed down the system price in Q1 and Q2. The high reservoir levels kept the Nordic system price low in the third quarter and also put pressure on the front end of the forward curve as you can see from the picture, comparing August and November forward curves for 2021, but very good to look at the area prices. So when looking at the system, which is the bottom gray line and comparing that to Swedish area prices 2 and 3 and Finnish area price, the picture is very, very different. System price in Q3 has been at €9, Swedish area price €2 and Finnish area prices, which are the most relevant for us, have been respectively at €25 and €33. So quite a remarkable difference compared to the system price. This is important to follow., How have we then fared against this backdrop? Comparing third quarter year-on-year, Nordic system spot was down 74%, but Fortum's Generation Nordic power price achieved price was actually up 4%. In Russia, on Q3, in the markets, the spot has been flat on a year-on-year basis. Calculated in euros, our achieved power price is minus 16% on the back of weaker ruble and lower CSA payments. Then before moving over to Timo's part, I will shortly go through the divisional performance. Overall, I could say that generation has been stable. Q3 and cumulative results were at a stable level. In Q3, nuclear production was down 0.7-terawatt hours on the back of the scheduled longer outages. But on the better side, hydro production and achieved power prices were higher., On a cumulative basis, hydro production was actually up 1.5-terawatt hours, nuclear lower on the back of the mentioned longer outages and achieved power prices were slightly down, but compared to the market prices, our achieved price has been supported by the good hedge levels. One thing to note though so is that in generation, the last 12-month RONA stands at 12.6%. Then moving over to Russia. Russia third quarter was down €13 million, mostly impacted by the FX impact of €11 million. Power and heat production was lower year-on-year. But so was the bad debt provision. So this more or less equaled each other out. On a cumulative basis, Russia is down €47 million on the back of lower volumes and margins, lower CSA payments and FX impact. But last 12 months RONA stands above 10% at 10.7%., City Solution in third quarter was stable. We had improved results in district heating business in Finland and Norway. And in Norway, the change in the Norwegian kroner exchange rate more than offset the negative impact of the lower power prices. The cumulative nine month result was down €35 million, but that was on the back of the weak Q1, with lower heat sales volumes due to the warm weather, lower power sales prices and then as a result, also a lower Norwegian heat sales prices. And then it's good to remember that the successful divestments of Joensuu and Järvenpää do have a negative impact in the City Solution business going forward., Consumer Solutions continued its very good performance. The Q3 was up €2 million. And this was the 12th consecutive quarter of comparable EBITDA improvement. I can say that we have been able to handle corona well and even during these times, we have been launching new digital services and increasing our value-added service customer base to record highs. So excellent performance from Consumer. Then as the fifth division, again, as a reminder, I will not go into more details and commenting on Uniper's operational performance. And consequently, I do not comment indeed the result development. Uniper published the Q3 report a week ago. And for further details, we refer to that and the presentations and webcasts that the company has had. But as general comments, I can state the obvious. The gas business followed the normal seasonal pattern with the weak third quarter. This was further pronounced by the intra-year optimization of the gas portfolio that was successfully and well utilized earlier this year, clearly improving the Uniper Q1 results while then resulting in a significant loss in the third quarter., I also want to shortly repeat the bridge from Uniper's adjusted EBIT to Fortum's Uniper segment operating profit. For Q3 this year, Uniper reported adjusted EBIT of €286 million negative that we record in the Uniper segment as comparable operating profit as a loss of €307 million. The difference relates to that we have deducted Uniper's associated company results of €11 million from their EBIT as they at Fortum are reported below the comparable operating profit line. Also, as Oskarshamn is a joint-owned company, we also make a correction for Fortum's share in OKG as Uniper fully consolidates it. 43% of Oskarshamn profit is already reported in our Generation segment. These corrections are done every quarter, which means that they will continue to be a difference between Uniper's reported adjusted EBIT and comparable operating profit as reported by Fortum in our Uniper segment., With this, I would now like to hand over to Timo, who will walk through the numbers in more detail. Timo, please?, Timo Karttinen, Thank you, Markus, and good morning, everybody, and welcome to this call on my behalf as well. I will first go through our comparable operating profit performance in the third quarter. We do not have comparison numbers from last year for Uniper, as we started to consolidate the comparable operating profit only in second quarter this year. Also, as said already, we are not commenting the details on the underlying performance in Uniper segment but rather refer to Uniper's on commentary and disclosure. Uniper's contribution to our comparable operating profit in Q3 was clearly negative, with the impact of the seasonality, especially related to the gas business. While Q1 there recorded very strong, obviously, Q3 was clearly loss-making., Overall, our comparable operating profit for third quarter declined €329 million, from €153 million last year to a loss of €176 million this year. As you remember, there has always been a clear seasonality in Fortum's quarterly results first quarter and last quarter being the strongest and second and third, the weakest. And now obviously, Uniper's result seasonality will also play here. Uniper has also confirmed, I said, their earlier full year guidance, which would indicate a strong result in that segment for the last quarter. The result drivers in generation were lower Nordic volumes, partly offset by higher achieved price., The relative stability of our achieved price is a proof of the importance of hedging to increase stability and predictability of cash flows and results. COVID-19 impact is visible in our Russia segment results, mainly indirectly as a consequence of lower oil production, that then has resulted in low power demand, lower power margins and lower volumes. The good news is that the COVID impact has been stabilizing, and we have also had lower bad debt provisions than last year. Russian segment results this quarter, year-on-year, mainly down because of the ruble exchange with an effect of €11 million. City Solutions profit was flat, while Consumer Solutions recorded their 12th consecutive quarterly profit increase., Then let's look at some other KPIs in our income statement. First, a reminder, for some time now, year-on-year comparisons will be difficult due to the changes in how Uniper has been consolidated. So let's run first through that. In 2019, Uniper was consolidated product ownership as an associate with one quarter lag in results. In 2020, first quarter, Fortum results included two quarters of Uniper associate result, last quarter last year and first quarter this year. All in all, €469 million of profits from associates. And then from second quarter onwards, Uniper is being consolidated as a subsidiary. Then in the items affecting comparability for this quarter, we have approximately €290, tax free sales gain from our Järvenpää district heating operations., So despite the negative comparable operating profit, our net profit was positive at €144 million. And third quarter operating results are negative, when looking at cumulative performance of our last 12 twelve months net profit amounts to €1.8 billion. Then to our financial net debt and main items of our cash flow during the year. In first quarter we updated our definition of net debt. Here is the bridge from start of the year leve of €4.8 billion in financial net debt to the level of €6.7 billion when consolidating the Uniper debt at the end of first quarter., During the year we have our cash flow from operating activities before net margin liabilities of roughly €1.8 billion. Its good to note that working capital fluctuations will continue to impact the quarterly operating cash flows. Cash flow from divestments has amounted to €1.2 billion. Largest divestments being, district heating operations in Joensuu and Järvenpää as well as Nordic wind portfolio. These cash flows together have more than covered the paid investments of EUR, 2.3 billion. Major part of the investments are related to Uniper shares. We also have strategic reviews ongoing related to our 50% stake in Stockholm Exergi and our Baltic and Polish district heating operations. Remaining cash flows after payments of investments have covered more than half of the paid dividends, so we have approximately €7.1 billion of financial net debt at the end of the third quarter. We continue to monitor and manage closely our net debt position and continue to strengthen our balance sheet., Our key priority is to have a solid investment-grade rating of at least BBB flat, and the focus on cash flows continues. We have good access to capital and ample liquid funds of €2.5 billion and undrawn credit facilities of €5 billion. Our total loan portfolio at the end of third quarter is €9.2 billion. The average interest for the debt portfolio is 1.7%, and the average interest for the euro part is 0.9%. We have only modest amounts of loans maturing in the near future. This year, short-term debt of approximately €600 million and, next year, €500 million bond maturities. Finally, I will conclude with our outlook. In Generation segment, the Nordic hedges, we have 85% hedged at €34 per megawatt hour for the rest of this year. 75% hedged at €33 for 2021. For comparison, one quarter ago, we had 65% hedged at €33 for 2021., Now we also disclosed the hedges for 2022, which are at 40% hedged and at €32. Uniper has likewise reported their Nordic hedges. And for 2021, they have 85% hedged at €28. One quarter ago, they had the 21 hedges at 80% hedged at €27. So we have been able to increase hedge levels for next year with relatively good prices. Please note that we have now updated our estimate for the annual capital expenditure, including maintenance and excluding acquisitions to be on €600 million level, and it was previously on €700 million level. This guidance does not include capital expenditure in the Uniper segment as we have given this originally in the beginning of the year, on the old Fortum level. And finally, no change to the income tax level, so the estimated comparable effective corporate income tax rate remains to be between 20% and 25%., And now we would be ready for questions and answers., Question-and-Answer Session"

Undue reliance should not be placed on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made and the facts and assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements., So, this is a snapshot of Geron today, and I'm delighted to run through it quickly, and then we'll dive into the details. First of all, we are developing an imetelstat, which is the first-in-class telomerase inhibitor, and we will talk in the next slide, next several slides, a little bit about the unique mechanism of action of this drug in targeting telomerase, which is an up-regulated target in hematologic myeloid malignancies., Now, if you look at the third column on the right, we have two Phase 3 trials that are - both of which have registrational intent and one of which is ongoing and one of which will be starting very shortly. The ongoing study is a randomized placebo controlled Phase 3 study in lower-risk MDS. This is in patients with relapsed/refractory to ESAs, and we expect the date to complete enrollment sometime in the second quarter of 2021 or by the end of the second quarter. And if that's achieved, we expect top-line results to be reported in the second half of 2022., We also have an upcoming randomized, overall survival Phase 3 study in Intermediate 2/high risk MF patients refractory to JAK inhibitors. And we plan to open that trial for screening enrollment in the first quarter of 2021. We expect a completion of enrollment in the second half of 2022 and interim analyses as early as the first half of 2023 and final top-line results in the first half of 2024. Both of these studies are based on compelling and differentiating Phase 2 data that we’ll go through in more detail. And that fits directly with the Phase 3 designs that we have implemented or implemented., Finally, I just would be remiss not to point out that we have a clinical and regulatory team that's highly experienced in developing therapies, therapeutics for hematologic malignancies in many of these people for quite a few years. So I'll skip to Slide 5 and I don't plan to spend a lot of time here. Many people know the story of the imetelstat. It is a novel telomerase inhibitor was discovered and developed by Geron with 100% of the molecule today., FDA has granted Fast Track and Orphan Drug designations for both lower risk MDS and Int-2/High-risk MF. The patent and market exclusivity is noted here, in particular composition of matter expires in 2024 in EU and 2025 in the U.S. However, patent term extension includes a potential five years in the EDU until 2029 and until 2030 in the U.S., and then we have methods of use patents that offer coverage from until 2033 for MF in the EU and until 2033 for both MDS and MF in the U S. And we do expect market exclusivity extension related to the orphan drug designation in EU for up to 10 years and in the U.S. for up to seven years., Now, the next slide is actually quite important. It speaks to the imetelstat mechanism of action. And in particular we shown in the upper left the normal course of hematopoiesis that is the formation of red cells, white cells, and platelets in normal bone marrow and on the right malignant hematopoiesis, which is the characteristic of both low risk MDS and. In malignant hematopoiesis, the stem, progenitor and blood cells have telomerase that is continuously upregulated, and this results in malignant hematopoiesis. And what this really hematopoiesis as we would see appears to be occurring in a number of these different areas., So let's talk for a moment about lower risk MDS. The key elements of this disorder are ineffective production of red cells, white cells, and platelets in other words, ineffective hematopoiesis. These patients are characterized by chronic anemia that also requires transfusions. The patient subgroups include both Ring Sideroblast Positive and Ring Sideroblast negative patients., We'll talk about that in a few minutes. And current treatments are initially with erythropoiesis stimulating agents like EPO, however, patients that are relapsed and refractory become transfusion dependent, and as noted here and has been noted by many people. Serial red cell transfusions really result in a lower quality of life, very significant costs, iron overload, shorter survival, and the higher risk of transformation to AML., Approximately 70% of all the MDS patients are lower risk. You see the numbers on the right-hand slide and what is really needed is a higher rate of transfusion independence than currently available options, durable transfusion independence, the ability to treat both RS positive and RS negative and ultimately of course, modifying diseases that modify the course - therapies that modify the course of the disease., Slide 9 is a very high level summary of the attributes of imetelstat as shown in the Phase II IMerge study in low-risk MDS, a very high rate of transfusion independence, and this is really particularly noted in terms of durability. And we'll come back to that in the next slide or two., We see efficacy in both RS positive and RS negative patients. We've also seen evidence of disease modifying activity, and some of this evidence will be presented at the upcoming presentation in some patients where we had 10 abstracts that were accepted. I think most important evidence of disease modifying activity is actually the fact that we see a very substantial durability of the transfusion independence and an increase in hemoglobin levels above and beyond three grams per deciliter at pre-treatment level., And that really is suggesting a potential recovery of normal hematopoiesis, which is what we're after can also show there is a molecular mechanistic background for this in which there is a reduction in the abnormalities of SF3B1, which is a gene associated with malignant hematopoiesis, as well as other cytogenetic abnormalities also are lower after treatment with the drug, all of which indicate impact overtime., And the safety profile has been very well described in the past. We do have a grade three, four cytopenias; however, close to 90% are resolved within four weeks and neutropenia 90% is resolved within four weeks. So we feel that this safety profile has been consistent for quite some time, you know, how to manage the drug. And we've had very, very, very limited number of clinical outcomes or clinical sequelae of these cytopenias., This is putting the key efficacy results in lower risk MDS in the context of other available products. In this case, in the Phase III - compared to the Phase III data, our Phase II, compared to the Phase III data with luspatercept, now known as Reblozyl as pronunciation as a single agent product that's been introduced by Celgene, now BMS is doing very well on the marketplace. We had similar target patient populations, relapsed refractory ESAs., We were able to study patients, who were both RS positive and RS negative, I'll remind folks that RS positive patients are about 25% of the population of low risk MDS patients and RS negative or about 75%. The biggest differences in our study of populations were in the baseline transfusion burden. Our patients had on average, a median of eight units of red light - packed red cells given over eight week range, compared to only five or the medalist population., And you can see that there is a subtext here that of close to 30% of the medalist patients actually have less than four units for eight weeks. Whereas all of our patients had four units per eight weeks or greater., If you go to the next circled red area. So if we do sort of apples-to-apples comparison of patients with baseline contusion burden of greater than four units for eight week. You can see that we had a slightly better eight week transfusion burden rate, but what's really striking with imetelstat is the duration of therapy., We've reported a very high rates for both 24 weeks, and now one year transfusion pre-intervals, close to 30% of the patients. And that's not been to our knowledge reported consistently from any other product. The median duration of red blood cell transfusion independence. The last one that we were able to get comparative data was 88 weeks for hemorrhage and 31 weeks or the NatWest data., So that's what's really led to this clinical trial design for IMerge, which mirrors the Phase II, you can see under the Phase III trial design, same, same, same. So same dosing influencing population. Many of the clinical sites also participated in the Phase II, many of the clinical team members are also managing the Phase III., So you can see that completion of enrollment is expected in the second quarter of 2021 top line results expected in the second half of 2022. And that is a really important date to keep in mind for the company that's when we're really focusing on all of our activities, we'll be meeting up to that TOR coming in the second half of 2022, many of our activities company., If we go onto myelofibrosis, I think that many people listening are probably quite familiar with them now, especially intermediate to high risk in that. The only approved therapies in the United States are JAK inhibitors. Ruxolitinib otherwise known as Jakafi. Unfortunately, well those are therapies and in particular, ruxolitinib still has the lion's share of utility or use in frontline patients., Unfortunately, many patients lose response to ruxolitinib such that within three years, approximately 50% of patients have discontinued rux, and about 75% would be five years. The thing that's really striking is that once you lose a responsiveness to ruxolitinib. You have a very poor survival, historical data suggests working 16 months for patients, who have discontinued rux. And so we've really identified that there is a deep need for therapies that can extend the survival, certainly extend survival beyond that., That's probably going to require disease modifying therapy, perhaps a non-JAK mechanism of action, which clearly we have. And most of all treatment options for patients who are refractory to JAK therapy. And this is of course the bulk of the patients are intermediate to high risk. You can see some of the other characteristics of this patient population to the lower right of the slide., So if we look now at how we view the IMbark data in the context of all of that. First of all, we studied patients to median OS and you can see, we have overall 28.1 months of median RS. And these were all in patients who are relapsed or refractory to a JAK inhibitor. So it obviously compares very favorably to the 14 to 16 months. We'll come to some real world data analysis that I think bear on this as well., We didn't have a very substantial improvement in MS symptoms. And we do have evidence of disease modifying activities, some of which will be reprised or discussed at ASH this year. So first of all, there are so-called driver mutations in this disease, which are JAK 2 V617F CALR in nipple. And we see a reduction in those driver mutations in the variant, the wheel frequency of those in patients treated over the long-term with imetelstat that indicates we are in fact targeting the underlying MF malignant clones., And we also see reductions in cytogenetic abnormalities that also indicate impact on malignant clones. So all of these reductions are in fact strongly correlated with improved clinical benefits, such as screen symptom improvement. And we see, again, a very consistent safety profile showing below., I’d highlight a little bit the real-world data, because, I think, it's a particularly strong analysis that led us to the conclusion that we should focus this on the OS in Phase 3, for this drug. You can see that we took a closely matched cohort of MS patients with discontinued ruxolitinib and then were subsequently treated with best available therapy, not a JAK 9., And we looked at their survival data and that's shown in red. And then we matched that - very closely matched cohort of patients were matched to the patients in the IMbark Phase 2 data, which you can see shows in the blue, because one or two patients could not be matched, OS was actually was a little bit longer in this cohort of patients among the imetelstat. But in any event, it's more than 2x the - approaching 3x the OS, the survival is substantially elongated compared to patients who just received BAT., So with that in mind, and the predecessor, other predecessor data, this is the refractory MF Phase 3 trial design. You can see, again, it's in patients who are refractory to treatment with a JAKi. In this case, we define being that refractory is inadequate spleen or symptom response after treatment with the JAK inhibitor for at least six months, and including an optimal dose of JAKi for at least two months. These patients will be randomized to receive either imetelstat or BAT. The BAT will exclude JAK arm because it had been shown to be refractory to treatment with that. And there will be both a final analysis of course, and an interim for OS. As far as we know, this is the only Phase 3 trial in intermediate-2 or high-risk MF that is actually using OS as the primary., And the final analysis is planned after 50% of the death events have occurred in the study. And interim analysis as planned after 70% of that 50%, or approximately 35% of the death events have occurred. Secondary endpoints as we’re expecting this is a very large global study. As I said, will include 320 patients we expect to have over 150 sites, we are, finishing up a qualification for sites. And our current expectation is that we will open enrollment, open for screening and enrollment in the first quarter of 2021, which is almost right around the corner., We're very excited by this study. It's been a long time in the company. And our KOLs and investigators are equally excited by the prospect of bringing imetelstat, this is a very needing population., So maybe I'll conclude with looking at a couple of - sort of development priorities, just making sure we go over those. You can see that we had a number of maturing data presentations at EHA earlier this year. And now we have, as we'll describe in the next slide, 10 abstracts that have been accepted at Edge, which occurs in early December of this year. , Again, to reprice some of the dates that we've given in the previous portion of this presentation, second quarter of 2021 to complete enrollment in the low risk MDS study, top-line results by the second half of 2022. And then for the refractory MF, we came to agreement in May with the Phase 3 trial design that I've shown you. We've been recruiting sites, finalizing the protocol, so forth, and so on going through all of the normal preparatory work to starting large Phase 3 study., We expect to open for enrollment, screening and enrollment first quarter of 2021. And as stated before complete enrollment by the second half of 2022, and hopefully have interim analysis somewhere in the first half of 2023 and a final top line results in the first half of 2024., Finally, just a word, with regard to the - with regard to the ASH meeting. So we have four oral presentations, we're quite pleased with that. We also have some nonclinical data and some posters that priced prior and some new data. The oral presentations, are broadly speaking, describing, both some of the clinical outcomes, many of which we've seen already, but also the potential disease modifying activity that I sort of alluded to in the top line and they’ll be, of course, discussed in far greater detail., Also an important oral presentation is the correlation of the clinical outcomes, for example, in high-risk MDS, to telomerase activity and that being diminished and hTERT expression being diminished. hTERT is one of the components of the telomerase molecule. And so these all correlate very beautifully to clinical outcomes. And finally we'll have some posters for trials in progress., So that sort of summarizes where we are today with imetelstat in these two very important indications. And I would highlight to everyone that we are eagerly awaiting the results of these Phase 3s. Obviously we will be in the process of developing both NDA readiness, ultimately commercial readiness, et cetera. Those will be topics for future presentations when we're ready to describe them in more detail. And for today, it's really a focus on the predecessor data that are now really informing the Phase 3 design and why we feel really quite good about these designs and going forward with this drug in these many patients., So maybe I'll stop there and turn it back to Steve. Steve, I don't know if you or others have any questions you'd like to ask., Steve Willey, Yes, no Chip that was great. Thank you. So I know that you kind of implied during the presentation that there's a lot of folks that are familiar with myelofibrosis just given all the development that we've seen there. But it seems like there's a lot fewer folks who are familiar with what's kind of going on in low-risk MDS and maybe that indication is getting a bit more attention now, just given the success of luspatercept. How do you think about the opportunity, the addressable opportunity in low-risk MDS relative to myelofibrosis?, John Scarlett, That's a great question. Thanks, Steve. Well, when we entered this field really back in 2012, 2013, MF really had a larger impact on the community of hematologists, oncologists, largely because the survival statistics were really terrible and they continue to be really pretty awful. There was very little development of new novel agents. And so I think that that was a lot of the focus. There was also a huge focus at the time on the understanding of the molecular basis and the mutations that were associated with them and associated with poor outcomes., So, you're quite right, low risk MDS sort of lagging behind a little bit. But - and I give all due credit to our colleagues at Acceleron, who have really indicated that and showing how important the transfusion learning is in patients who have low risk MDS, and it really affects both their lifestyle. I suspected that effects survival, although we don't have the long-term follow-up bite yet on them. But what we do see is that patients who have to take these transfusions, it's costly, it causes morbidity and even mortality. So, we've really been able to pivot not only to MF, which has been a longer path for us because we've gone the overall survival route, but also to - to low-risk MDS. And we've just had outstanding results, and especially in terms of durability of the transfusion independence., So I think we feel really great. It looks like a lower risk MDS is sort of the first up for a potential commercialization. I think we feel great about that. In a sense it's a source of great need. Finally, I would just like to say, red blood cell, Luspatercept is doing very well in the market and that tells you that there hadn't been anything. So it's been 10 years. So I think they're really stimulating a lot of people's interest in the market. Some analysts have been doing peak sales over $800 million and probably a little bit more. So I feel very good about the lineup that we have right here., Steve Willey, Great. And when you think about kind of competing with Luspatercept and I guess like post-DSA or low-risk MDS patients, do you think that you're going to be getting some of those lower transfusion, RS positive patients, or those more likely to be candidates for Luspatercept just kind of given the benign tolerability profile of that drug. And do you kind of view yourself as being more competitive against Luspatercept than that and that higher transfusional burden, patient population, which I think is at least epidemiologically pretty reflective of what you saw in your trial, if I remember correctly in a two?, John Scarlett, Well, we had a minimum. You have to have a transfusion burden and they allow patients down to two. So there was a little bit of a mismatch there. So we - but the answer is, I think that we will split the market. I don't think there's much doubt about that in my mind. I also think that we probably will be viewed as a more potent drug in terms of dealing with patients with very high transfusion burden, exactly because of the data that we showed. We show that we're very effective and we have longer durability with that, but there is a bit of a ways to go between now and when we would launch., And so I think it will be fascinating to see how the market takes this up, takes up both these kind of steps. How that plays out in - in patients with higher transfusion burden and where we ended up getting patient trials. I suspect that we'll get them in both. Yes, right now, it's like we have potentially a more - a drug that's very usable and induces a very durable transfusion dependency patients with quite High-Transfusion Burden, which there are a lot of patients like that., Steve Willey, And I know when we think about JAKi refractory myelofibrosis, patient prognosis is obviously pretty dismal. But I know it's even a lot worse for those JAKi refractory patients who actually have those triple negative mutations. And you've shown a really pronounced clinical benefit in those triple negative patients specifically. Did you give any thought as to maybe try to pre-specify that as kind of a carvable patient population within the Phase 3 trial?, John Scarlett, Yes. We have. And I would say - to that I would say first, I think we wanted, it looked to us as if we had a very broad patients, who were refractory to JAKi inhibitors. And as a consequence, we really wrote the trial to mimic the Phase 2 data that we have that was so strong. I think the triple negative patients are a smaller, but very intensely interesting patient population. We are continuing to have discussion with KOLs, who treat substantial numbers of these patients. And, I would just simply say, stay tuned we may focus on this at sometime in the future, but right now, I think the first big indication we wanted as far as possible in the JAKi refractory population., Steve Willey, Okay. And you mentioned this asset remains wholly owned and strategically unencumbered, I guess, how do you envision ex-U.S. commercialization playing out? Is that something you'd like, the assistance of a partner to help out with, or do you guys have had aspirations of independently commercializing this new state?, John Scarlett, Well, I think the important element here is that, no one will speak for our drug more soundly or with more conviction than us. We've been developing this drug for a long time. We've seen all of these correlations. We feel really strongly about the drug being very useful addition to that being carrying. And I think if that includes a potential commercialization on our own, in order to return the highest possible return to our shareholders, we would strongly consider that if it would mean a global deal that would allow again, a blow out of the lifecycle management program, we would consider that., If it means half and half where we would commercialize either with or without a partner in the U.S. and have an ex-U.S. separate commercialization part, we will consider that. All of these options are on the table. We are considering all of them. The major task is to make sure that we maximize the value for the longest period of time of this drug and I think we have that squarely in our sites., Steve Willey, Okay. And then maybe just lastly, if you could just kind of quickly hit on the balance sheet for us and, your ability to execute on these milestones that you've laid out the course of the next couple of years?, John Scarlett, I think we're in really good shape. We had $274 million at the end of the third quarter. And that is sufficient to see us through to the end of 2022, when we expect to have top-line results, or we certainly hope we have top line results from our lower risk MDS. So I think that relieves some of the financing burden between now and then, and we look forward to getting there and turning that part over., Steve Willey, Very good. Well, that’s all we have the time. Chip, thank you very much, really appreciates it during the rest of your day, and through the rest of 2020., John Scarlett, Thanks very much, Steve and thanks for your…, Steve Willey, There will be a tough around ASH., John Scarlett, Okay. Thanks. All right. Bye-bye., Question-and-Answer Session"

23726,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4389839-visa-inc-v-management-presents-citi-financial-technology-virtual-conference-transcript,Vasant Prabhu - Vice Chairman and CFO,"Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citi, Ashwin Shirvaikar, Good afternoon. This is Ashwin Shirvaikar, Citi's Payments Analyst and Global Co-Head of FinTech Research. So, we have over 700 registrants for the conference. I know that for a majority of you, this session is one you all have been waiting for. So without further delay, let me welcome Visa. And from Visa, we're fortunate to have Vasant Prabhu, who is a Vice Chairman and CFO. Vasant, welcome to our event., Vasant Prabhu, Thank you, Ashwin, thanks for having me., Ashwin Shirvaikar, Absolutely. I thought it would be maybe a good idea to start off talking about sort of the structural changes that you see in the payments landscape going forward. And particularly given what we've gone through this year, because of the pandemic and so on and so forth, I'm thinking e-commerce acceleration, I'm thinking the emergence of buy now pay later, not that that's related necessarily to the pandemic, but that is our alternative payment mechanisms, a lot of stuff going on. So give us your view of the structural changes in the payments landscape., Vasant Prabhu, Sure. We had our Investor Day in February and we talked about our conviction that there was an extraordinary amount of growth ahead of us, a 10x opportunity. And I think what the pandemic has done effectively is accelerated a lot of that as you describe. One of the more obvious ones, of course, is the acceleration of the shift of e-commerce. Now the shift has been underway for a while, but only 15% of consumer payments were actually e-commerce coming into 2020 and there's no question there's been an acceleration in that. And you can see that from the numbers that we've reported., You've seen some massive growth in our e-commerce side of the business growing significantly faster than it was pre-pandemic in an economy that clearly is not growing as fast almost anywhere in the world. So one thing that's happened is the massive shift to e-commerce and we're seeing that in all categories - categories that historically were not heavy on e-commerce like food and drug, for example. So that's clearly one structural shift. It's also important to note that something we've been watching very closely is what happens to this when face-to-face commence is possible again. And as economies have opened up in the past few months, we've seen e-commerce stay very strong even as face to face commerce is possible, which means that the habits that people have formed in the past few months are sticking., We've seen significantly more people activate their cards online and we're seeing more transactions for card online, which means that the whole move of people away from face-to-face commerce to e-commerce has definitely seen a step change and it's sticking. The other things that goal of e-commerce, of course, is it gives us a clear opportunity to sell value-added services. Certainly, fraud and authentication are all important things in cyber security are far more important online than they are face-to-face. Products like Visa Advanced Authorization and Visa Risk Manager, we have screened over 116 billion online face-to-face transactions or what it tells them issuers in 125 markets, for example., Our tokenization services are incredibly important online, 1.4 billion tokens, we just crossed that milestone; again, 8,300 issuers of tokens across 192 markets, our quick to base off to a good start. 15,000 merchants live in 16 markets. And then omnicommerce to CyberSource is also getting a big boost. So the whole shift to e-commerce comes with a lot of benefits. Face-to-face too people now don't want to use cash. Cash is dirty. And so we've seen a substantial move away from cash to digital forms of payment, quick to pay, I mean, tap to pay is clearly helping it. Tap to pay is now two thirds of transactions outside the U.S., over 40% on a global basis, many markets have seen massive increases in tap to pay., Benefit - and debit is a big beneficiary. So you can see the shift away from cash in our debit business, which is growing twice as fast. So two of the big structural shifts, now, beyond that, we're seeing big improvements in our new flows business. B2B, massive growth, massive growth in disbursements, I think this has been a big boost to Visa Direct. If you look at our Visa Direct numbers, you wouldn't even know there's a pandemic going on. It continues to grow at rates as we saw pre-pandemic, which is extremely high in the 60% and 70% range., And then installments, we’ve talked about it. We approached it in two ways. We have partnerships to do with. We have investments in companies Klarna and Paidy and we partnered with a bunch of other people like - and we also enable it in our own network. There's just a lot going on multiple fronts that highlights what we said in February that the opportunity is large. And what this has shown is that things are accelerating and sticking., Ashwin Shirvaikar, Yes, that's a great setup and we'll get into many of those topics in detail. But first I want to ask about - the world has spent the better part of 2020 dealing with the pandemic. Through this summer we saw recovery in payment volumes, but then that seems to have kind of started out. There isn't certainly a linear pace of any kind, particularly we see the recent cases in multiple geographies and so on. So give us an idea of what Visa's planning process has been like in terms of dealing with this extreme uncertainty., Vasant Prabhu, Yes, I think you described it and then calling it extreme uncertainty, right. We're dealing with a hundred-year event. The world has never seen this in our lifetimes. We have never seen shutdowns of economies and things like that. So, we started to see this as you know in about February when we saw the first impact in Asia. And we knew immediately that we have to start to act on it. So we didn't wait. We started to act relatively. We started to really focus on three things. And we have said that we are all the way through, the first is rigorous prioritization. We knew that this was going to have an impact on our business. So we started the process of figuring out what the real priorities that we have to make sure we sustain investments in, what can we make, what can we cut., And we made all those decisions fairly quickly. And you saw that we started to scale back the level of investment almost immediately in our second fiscal quarter. And then in the third and fourth, our expense base are actually down about 4% to 5%. So prioritization becomes extremely important angular to these, some of them are obvious. I mean, if borders are shutdown, there isn't going to be a lot of cross border travel. So a lot of marketing director towards soft cross-border spending is probably not very useful because people are not traveling because they can't. The Olympics didn't happened, certainly that helped us., The second thing is to be very focused on what is happening with our business drivers almost on a daily basis. So we have a very granular and almost daily understanding of how trends are changing, um, because you can't predict these trends. We don't pick them to be able to predict two and three quarters out, which is why we have chosen, provide an outlook. But what that means is that you really have to monitor trends and understand how the trend is changing, where the trend is changing and why the trend is changing, so that you can then understand how the business might play out over the next several weeks until the trend changes again., So we are very focused on it. We told you, for example, in the fourth fiscal quarter, we saw an improvement in the cross-border business on the travel side in the month of September. And we knew very quickly why because some models were opening up. And you saw that Mexico, U.S. Mexico, U.S. Caribbean opened up. We saw some significant improvements there. Turkey opened up. So it wasn't a based improvement. It was borders opening up. So we sort of had a feel for how that's going to play out., So the second thing is really monitoring trends very closely and planning accordingly. And then the third thing will be to stay very flexible. You really have to be willing to adjust your plans based on how the trends are changing. Right now, for example, there's anxiety about spiking infections, and so they are monitoring very closely what impact is going to have on our business. And one of the things we're finding is it you know depends on what the reaction to the spikes and infections is. If the spike in infections is causing the elements to shut things down, it has one impact. If the spike in infections isn't causing the elements to take action, because some governments just are not, it has a different impact, and different cultures have different impacts., So there is no single answer to what the impact is when infection spike. And once again, you have to react accordingly. So prioritization is important, close monitoring is important, flexibility is important. And then agility moving really fast to respond is also very important. So that's how we tried to react to this. We stay flexible. We adjust plans as we go along. I know many of you would like us to tell you what the next year four quarters is going to look like chosen not to do that because it would be I think disingenuous of us to tell you that we can forecast that far out, not for all this though, there've been too clearly as a rule that we've kept our foot on the pedal., The first is our new closed business. As I said earlier, it's growing extremely fast. Visa Direct is really doing well. So we are not scaling back any level of investment in that. And the other is our value added services business. We told you that it was growing in the mid-teens. I believe the growth in 2020 was about 18% for our value added services through the year. And they're very excited about that. So there is some parts of our business that pandemic or not have continued to grow at a very steady clip, and we remain very focused on investing in them., Ashwin Shirvaikar, Got it, got it. An add-on question is that coverage discussion for payments companies, it's often tend to be limited to consumer spending trends. You mentioned, your flows business. I mean Visa obviously has exposure to B2B payments. What are you seeing in that part of the market? How are businesses reacting?, Vasant Prabhu, Yes, I have really look at B2B, there are sort of three components to the B2B business as we discussed in Investor Day. One is the sort of the traditional God days B2B business, where the bulk of a historical B2B business hasn't been. And that breaks down into sort of small businesses and large and medium-sized businesses from a used cards, [00:12:51] G&E and e-cards and those kinds of purposes., What I've seen there is that the small business part of it hasn't begun to recover. In many ways, it's recovering like the consumer businesses. As we told you on the call on the domestic consumer side, we've seen sort of the V-shaped recovery. Small businesses have tended to recover along those lines. Now part of it is because a lot of them in those areas is not travel related., And so they're buying things they need to run their business. And so we've seen a recovery there. The larger size businesses are not recovering as fast. So they are still a little sluggish, not then midsize market on the B2B side. Cross- border side, we have B2B Connect that is scaling, they excited about it. We think there is significant opportunity there. And hopefully in the next few quarters, we can tell you more about, you know, how things are scaling on the B2B side - either B2B Connect. And then a lot enterprise B2B you know, the only RDAP site that's in its early days. So the pandemic, I think, you know, did not impact that much because it's still not a huge business. And also trying to figure out, where the value creation opportunity is in that business. , But look, I mean, B2B is a big opportunity. We remain very focused on it. We think there is huge opportunities in the traditional B2B business, and we're very excited about the value we can add in the cross-border B2B business. So that's a concern on the B2B front on this one., Ashwin Shirvaikar, Got it. One other trend, obviously we've all seen debit growth outpacing credit and that's understandable card pay based on very sharp harpy that eminent stimulus impact, things like that essential services and so on., In general, as we move towards normalcy, and by normalcy, I'm not suggesting that we'll go completely back the other way. I think what helps debit has, you know, permanently gained some shares. But it’s kind of easy to see that T&E transactions, they tend to be more credit-based. So would you agree with that and other factors that you think continue to sustain robust debit growth as we start to see a behavior normalization?, Vasant Prabhu, Yes. So, there is no question whatsoever that debit has become the engine for cash, right? But so the bulk of the cash conversion that has accelerated through this pandemic as manifested debit, and you can see that in the numbers of debit businesses are growing twice as fast as it was pre-pandemic, despite the fact that the economies are doing worse than they will be pre-pandemic., So there is no question that all that growth is coming from cash conversion. Some of the reasons why. And the first is, even at a physical point of sale, people are preferring to use digital forms of payment and debit tends to be the preferred form of payment., We are seeing a substantial increase in e-commerce and everyday spend categories like food and drug, for example, like some retail goods, and every expanding tends to be skewed towards debit. So that's clearly helping debit. That is an element in talk times for people to use debit rather than credit. Like they'd rather use money., They have in the bank than borrow money. Now we saw that in the last crisis and it took about two or three years for that to normalize, but we think this crisis is different. We think in this case, because of the nature of this crisis, it's not strictly an economic crisis. It is also as you know a pandemic that is causing people who change habits, adopt more digital palms of payment, move more online. This is a structural shift that is benefiting debit. So why did some of them move from debit to credit will change overtime and see people feel more confident. There is a structural element here that makes debit another part of the business., Overall, the only thing I would point to is that Visa Direct is largely debit veils. And Visa Direct, as you know is growing extremely fast. And there are new use cases that these direct is enabling that didn't exist before. And that's a structural shift to that is in favor of debit account., A couple of other things I might add is you've a phenomenal job in the last few years, signing up wallets around the world, right? Wallets have a massive engine of financial inclusion, politics are a massive engine in emerging markets, open up new acceptance. So there are new consumers and new merchants accepting digital forms of payment, and then embedding our credentials and these wallets and all the big ones like Paytm, LINE Pay, Safaricom, Gojek et cetera. Along with its debit, they're all payment banks, they can issue that credentials. That's medicating debit too. So it's become a big engine of financial inclusion in emerging markets. So when you put it all together, you know, there is clearly a structural shift in favor of debit, which I believe will sustain also the pandemic., Ashwin Shirvaikar, Okay. Now that's - thank you for that. How should the investors think then about the differences in yield between debit and credit transactions?, Vasant Prabhu, Yes, I mean, generally speaking, the yields are relatively comparable. They can vary from market-to-market. But deals can sometimes be better. But overall, like the debit business we have around the world and it's a good business from a use standpoint., Ashwin Shirvaikar, Okay. Cross-border, I'm sure it has become one of your favorite topics to talk about. It's one of the common questions we get given how important it's perceived to be sort of for your financials. So I mean, you guys have done a good job of breaking it out. There is, non-family ecommerce, there is corporate T&E. There is consumer travel. Are we missing anything significant in those categories? And can you talk about sort of the yields across each of those key categories?, Vasant Prabhu, Sure. So just to remind everyone, the things we've said before, you know, two-thirds of our cross-border volumes are travel-related before coming into the pandemic. One third-was e-commerce. Of course, as travel has been hit hard. The mix is different today, but pre-pandemic sponsored. The other important thing to note, which is very relevant as you start to think about how the cross-border business might recover, is that the biggest chunk of it, the vast majority of it is consumer oriented, not commercial., A lot of commercial travel tends to happen outside of cards, you know, companies will pay for airlines and hotels and all that in other ways. So the bulk of our cross-border business is consumer related, not commercial. So I think that's important to know., In terms of yields, the yields are relatively similar between business and consumer, whether it's card present, card not present. So I don't think the yields are that dissimilar liens are higher, of course, in the domestic business, which you all know., I think the other important thing to note is that people may have the tendency to draw some conclusions on what's going on with cross-border business. I would say that the important factor to remember is that people can't travel to there. I bought us up close the vast majority of borders. I think we gave you the statistics. I think 99% of the borders, according to the World Tourism Organization, which is keeping tabs on this are either completely closed or have massive friction like quality teams., There is only 1% of borders that can still travel three. And so one of the things we are watching is what is happening in those corridors, where travel is relatively free and we're seeing some massive improvements, right. So people do want to travel if they can., So there's a lot of pent-up demand. And as soon as one of these things open, you see massive improvements. We told you about U.S., Mexico, 40-point recovery from April to July. It actually grew by 20% in September and October., Now some of it is because people can't travel anywhere else. So this border is getting, this border is getting a lot of the travel. Don't be welcomed up in and out. And we saw massive improvements that just within a month and the month of August and September, certain parts of the Middle East the Gulf countries are generally open for people to travel in and out of, we've seen some big gains there. Russia people are traveling in and out of Russia to the neighboring countries, not to Europe, but to countries of the former Soviet Union., So what we're seeing is that, when people can travel, there is a lot of travel. So they're not seeing a lot of structural changes in people's propensity to travel, time will tell how this is going to recover. We'll be closely monitoring how bodies are reopening. Let me talk to you again. And, January, we'll tell you more about that other borders have opened up and what the trends we're seeing now. You know what I mean, very optimistic about this business., In the meantime, the e-commerce business cross-border is booming. As you saw, it is growing, much faster than it was the real crisis. We're finding that as more business moves online, you know, people don't care as much whether product is coming from, so there is a lot of cross-border e-commerce that this pandemic has also enabled., And so that's one of the bigger business, even when this crisis ends. I mean, the cross-border e-commerce business could be a larger share of the business even after the cross lot of travel business recovery. But the big question mark right now is revenue borders. And we'll keep you posted on what we learn. You can obviously keep tabs on it yourselves. My monitoring, what various organizations are doing, and they tell you what's going on border-by-border, it's worthwhile at the moment or that, because we want to know what might be going on with the cross-border business., Ashwin Shirvaikar, Got it. So as we keep tabs on with the borders reopening, are there certain border pairs or corridors that become or have historically been more important for you in terms of cross-border, U.S. Brazil, U.S. China, U.S. to certain parts of U.K. or Continental Europe, anything you could share on that?, Vasant Prabhu, Yes. You know, it's interesting that our cross- border business is extremely diversified. Right, so you might think that, you know, cross-border business from U.S. to China is a big share of our business or U.S. to U.K. or U.S. to Europe. Yes, some corridors are larger than others, but it's exchanged of us., There is no one quality or that has like a meaningful chunk. So in that sense, I don't think there is molecule corridors that matter more than others. It is very likely that as the borders reopen the way the cross-border business recovers may not look like what it was before. Right. So we always thought, perhaps there'll be bilateral arrangements. Certainly within Europe, intra Europe travel has picked up pretty fast, because they were fairly open, of course, our views on that are like domestic., So we don't talk about it very much inside Europe. It would be when certain corridors open up for sure. I mean, you mentioned Brazil, Brazil is relatively open and they're seeing a fair amount of travel into an outer Brazil where they're allowed to go, right. I mean, still not to the U.S., U.S., U.K. still closed. U.S. China still closed in many ways. I mean, people can travel, but the quarantines and all that, you know, we could see Australia, New Zealand open up at some point. You could see countries in Asia do bilateral arrangements., We could see countries in Latin America open up as you see now, some of them opening up to each other. But they're not yet at a point where there is a large amount of that going on. Right, people are still, I think monitoring trends, certainly in the spikes and infections in Europe and the U.S. have probably going to give people a little pause, a moment where I can see where they can see., Ashwin Shirvaikar, Got it. Okay. So let's move to talk about rebates and incentives. We know that more heavily weighted to incentives rather than rebates. We know you've been exceptionally busy in doing a lot of stuff. We know mix is important. So I guess a few questions. One is why I didn't send it was more tied to domestic volumes. Is there something structured over there?, Vasant Prabhu, No. So two reasons, number one, on the vast majority appliance, not always exceptions. The volume tried to cross-border is relatively small. So historically, you know, incentives depend on the volume of client gives you. And so when the vast majority of the volume is domestic, it's not surprising that the incentives will be tied more to that total volumes, because the client wants to say, Hey, I'm giving you X billion. I need to be treated like a client giving you X billion, not maybe that 5% or 6% of its cross-border, but they would like the incentives to be tied to their total volume. So it's been more common to tie incentives to total volumes, not this costs more than one., The second is our cross-border business is a very valuable business, right? We do uniquely basically people can do cross-border like we do, you can go anywhere in the world and your credentials are valid. And in real time, you can buy things. Merchants love it, because that's the way they get your business. So there hasn't been a desire for on our part also to attach incentives, to cross model, because we view it as a very high value service., You know, we shouldn't be - banks love it. I mean, they love the idea that they can give you a credential that can be used anywhere in the world. We don't need to give people incentives to offer our cross-border business. That's been a little bit of the history., There are unique situations. So mostly on the credit side, and there may be some credit portfolios that are just cross-border, right because they're a travel product or something like that. In those cases, yes, you will find that incentives are linked across border. There is those times you'll say, Hey, I mean, the bulk of my business is cross-border. So you have to acknowledge that, and so you can have some portfolios that cross-border matters and it's an important element of the discussion around incentives, trillion good times, and helped us a lot and went across what it comes back. It's going to help us a lot., Clearly, nobody expected a pandemic that for first time in a hundred years actually shut down borders. I don't think anybody would have anticipated worldwide that you couldn't cross-borders. So it works both ways, right? The fact that we don't pay incentives across border helps you in good times, if you're having this unusual environment and all of a sudden cross-border travel is not possible, and you lose that high yielding volume, it definitely helps you., Ashwin Shirvaikar, Yes, yes. So as a corollary to that, is it fair to say then that the ongoing pandemic has really not affected the incentive negotiation, if you will?, Vasant Prabhu, Well, I think, now people on both sides. We and clients have seen what happens in times like these. Of course, there'd be some discussions about this perhaps, but I don't think that would be fundamentally a very big change., Ashwin Shirvaikar, Got it. I was hoping maybe we could kind of move to talk about maybe some of your new flows. You've mentioned Visa Direct and the growth in Visa Direct a few times. When you kind of think of the key use cases that keep driving Visa Direct, could you maybe talk about some of those maybe from a demographic perspective, gig economy and what we've seen in spite of the pandemic, the rise of online marketplaces need for immediate funding, things like that. I mean, can you talk about what drives Visa Direct and maybe some metrics around it?, Vasant Prabhu, Sure. I think we share, first of all, I mean this is one of the most exciting parts of our business. And I would just say once again that people should not think about Visa Direct as a product, Visa Direct is a capability, right. Visa Direct is a capability that enables use cases in B2C, businesses to consumers, disbursements, B2B in various elements of B2B, especially in small ticket transactions, high volume, and even G2C, government-to-consumer., So, fundamentally, it's a vast expansion of what we as a business can do. And we started talking about it three or four years ago, most of you are scratching your heads, wondering what it was. It's growing in the mid to high 60s now, even through the pandemic. We ended the year with 3.5 billion transactions, which is up 2 billion over 2019., We are going into more and more use cases. So just to give you an idea of some of the big use cases B2B all know, in the U.S. for example, B2B saw 90% year-over-year growth in transactions. We are now signing up. We have signed up a whole bunch of remittance players, remittances are bigger than foreign direct investments in terms of order flows. So, right now, MoneyGram, Western Union, Remitly are all utilizing it., And pretty much they're adding all the remittance players. This we think is a business that will ramp very fast. Earthport that we acquired a year ago will be a critical element of doing a cross border disbursements through remittances. That's a huge use case, a very big use case as you said is what we call on-demand payroll. You can revolutionize payroll. We're seeing significant growth in on-demand payroll as well as payments to gig economy workers., So while payments to Uber drivers may have gone down now, we're seeing a big increase in delivery drivers right now in terms of disbursements. And the other area that’s seeing massive growth is insurance payments to consumers, disbursements done by insurance companies. We're seeing a huge increase in that. In the B2B area, merchant settlement has been impacted that small merchants have been hurt by the pandemic by the marketplaces are booming past merchant settlement is a big element of growth for Visa Direct. In the last 12 months, Visa Direct is - payouts to over 2 million U.S. small businesses and sellers., So, what you're really seeing is that an extraordinary number of intermediaries are showing up that are creating businesses. So, for example, Wagestream is an earned wage access provider in Europe, they're now creating a big, big business and they're a Visa Direct partner. So there are a lot of these intermediaries coming up that are scaling the business for us. These are early days in Visa Direct. I mean, there's - the opportunities lost, and I would direct you to our Investor Day presentation, where - business, went through all the various businesses we can build based on this capability., And its large areas of the economy, which is why, as we said at Investor Day, Visa Direct is what enables our network of network strategy, we’re network agnostic and we move money, and it's also what allows us to go from being an enabler of consumer payments fundamentally moving money. So think about Visa Direct as opening up vast new areas, right, and fundamentally changing what we do as a business. From moving money - from enabling consumer payments to moving money from being sort of a payments network to being a network of networks and Visa Direct is at the top of it and these are just early days., Ashwin Shirvaikar, Got it. Vasant, unfortunately, we're out of time on this session. I know I had a much longer list of questions. A lot of exciting stuff going on as you mentioned at the top of the call. Really appreciate your joining. Thank you for your insights and for those in the audience thank you all for joining. Up next, we have a Square CFO, Amrita Ahuja, and Pete is going to speak with Amrita. Thank you, Vasant., Vasant Prabhu, Thank you, Ashwin. Bye., Question-and-Answer Session"
23725,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4389838-regeneron-pharmaceuticals-inc-regn-presents-jefferies-virtual-london-healthcare-conference,Robert Landry - CFO,"Biren Amin - Jefferies, Biren Amin, Welcome, everyone, to the Jefferies London Virtual Health Care Conference. My name is Biren Amin. I’m one of the biotech analysts here at Jefferies. I’d like to welcome Regeneron and their Chief Financial Officer, Robert Landry; as well as Head of Investor Relations, Justin Holko. So before -- this will be a fireside chat format. So before we get started with the Q&A, I believe you have forward-looking statements that you’d like to read, and then maybe we can get started. But welcome, Bob and Justin, and thanks for attending our conference., Robert Landry, Sure, Biren. Thanks very much for the invite. This is a conference we’ve been at the last couple of years and have always enjoyed attending that. And to everyone on the virtual environment, good morning and good afternoon to everybody., So as Biren said before we begin, let me remind you that today, there will be remarks on this webcast, that will include forward-looking statements by Regeneron and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ. Everybody knows a complete description of these and other materials can be found in our SEC filings, including our recently filed November 5 10-Q in our year-end 10-K we do not undertake any obligations to update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events are otherwise., So I told Biren before we jump right into Q&A, I was going to just give a very brief kind of recap on the quarter. I mean it is still very fresh, given our collaborations, we always kind of be -- we’re always one of the late presenters because we need to get, obviously, the Bayer and Sanofi information to roll up our financial statements., So having said that, we had a very, very strong third quarter earnings, which included broad-based double-digit growth on both the top and bottom line. Again, we’re talking 32% on the top and 25% on the bottom. On the commercial front, I think we surprised everybody with EYLEA. The expectations were very low going into the quarter, and we had a really nice rebound. We’re -- our reps are still in the virtual format with regardsto the promotion. But clearly, we were able to get people back into the doctor’s offices and kudos to the retinal offices and being able to kind of adapt to this environment., We are closely monitoring what we’re seeing with regards to COVID-19 coming back, and it may impact future demand in Q4. So we got a close eye on that., With regards to Dupixent, again, another strong performance. I like, and I encourage people to go to the 10-Q, I mean, we’re starting to get some nice leverage with regards to the profitability associated with that, that helped to drive our Sanofi collaboration revenue numbers., On the R&D pipeline, we presented Phase 3 Dupixent asthma information, which was very, very good. We expect the filings to be in first quarter of 2021. We are granted FDA breakthrough designation on EoE. So again, we’re starting a Part B of the Phase 3 study in 2022. We’re very hopeful on that., We filed Libtayo, both the non-small cell lung in BCC, and we received PDUFA events, and that’s coming up actually at the end of February and early March. And actually, we got priority review on both non-small cell lung. And we provided -- people may have seen abstracts with regards to the upcoming ASH trial. So that’s out there, and we’re eager to present that in early December at the ASH meeting., COVID-19, there’s a lot out there. I personally thought some of the progress and the good diversification we made in the fourth quarter was our third quarter was washed over by all the COVID information. I mean, I get how important that is. But certainly, there’s a lot of other things happening at Regeneron other than COVID and Biren with that, we can jump into things. Again, we also announced -- and I want to highlight this, we made it to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the second year in a row, something that we’ve been striving for and that we’re very proud, and we’re starting to make really nice efforts in our kind of ESG environment. So Biren with that kind of intro, let me kick it over to you for the first question., Question-and-Answer Session"

23720,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4389825-roku-inc-roku-management-presents-rbc-capital-markets-global-technology-internet-media,Steve Louden - CFO,"Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets, Shweta Khajuria - RBC Capital Markets, Mark Mahaney, All right, let's get started out my snack break. Hello everybody, I'm Mark Mahaney at RBC, Shweta Khajuria and I are co-hosting Seattle Steve Louden or Steve Seattle Louden, the CFO of Roku for the next 30 minutes. If you have any questions you want us to ask or you want to ask, there's a Q&A box at the bottom. Please feel free to type in questions as the days gone by, we've gotten more and more people use that functionality. So and we have been asking those questions, Steve, thanks a ton for joining us. I know we only got 30 minutes. This is glibly and maybe overly glibly put the Vaccine conference, first time that many companies, investors are looking at companies post what looks like very promising vaccine., And hopefully you'll return to normalcy. Would you expect that to have any major impact on your business, which is another way of asking, you think that the COVID crisis served had any permanent impacts or semi-permanent impacts on Roku’s business that will be reversed to go into back to normalcy?, Steve Louden, Yes, hi Mark, and thanks to you and Shweta for hosting us here. This is always a great conference. And so the virtual incarnation will be interesting. Yes, when I look at the world, you get back to the fundamental promise of Roku that all TV will be streamed. And the corollary to that is that all TV advertising will be streamed. And so the COVID impacts for us have been largely an accelerant that trend toward that end state. And so certainly, there have been some puts and takes but Roku has been relatively fortunate in terms of accelerated interest in both streaming players, TVs that's resulted in accelerating active account growth for Roku over the last couple of quarters., And then certainly there's been puts and takes on the advertising. But we see that the COVID impacts have been disrupting a lot of the traditional industry structures around advertising up fronts or the theatrical windowing. And so those are all positive factors. I don't think that when the COVID crisis subsides, hopefully sooner rather than later with the prospect of these vaccines, that it's going to change anything because we do believe that long-term trend is still intact, but rather we're just still getting there faster than we probably would have otherwise. But I feel good about the trajectory of the business, the resilience of it regardless of whether we were in a COVID crisis or not, because people are voting with movies streaming and our research suggests that they're very happy once they move up to streaming. So they're not going back to the old world and paid more for a cable bundle, regardless of whether we're out of the woods on COVID or not., Mark Mahaney, And Steve, do you think that COVID crisis with the advertiser side is great kind of a tipping point and we've had quite a long period of time here in which Linear TV campaigns may have been offset upended live. Sports did come back live, but really crowd for a lot of people that wasn't people or crowds watching sports rather than watching sports. So do you think that there is evidence that there really wasn't an inflection in just TV ad budgets migrating online to?, Steve Louden, Yes, I think the disruption related to COVID has been a positive factor for the move to streaming. Folks that may have heard me talk before, I've talked about the phenomenon pre-COVID many times that the viewership has been moving over to streaming at increasing rates. But the ad budgets have been lagging significantly. And I think a lot of that has to do with the inertia of the traditional TV upfront process where the networks have done a fine job of trying to entice TV advertisers to spend a little more in the upfront process for next year based on some perceived scarcity., While at the same time over the last five years, TV ratings have gone down by about half. But I think what you found is that when advertisers were very concerned especially early in the pandemic impacts around the amount of ad budget that they were spending and needing to curtail that, they looked a lot harder at the fact that under the traditional upfront process, they were spending, vast majority of their TV budgets six to 12 months out and they did not have flexibility. And so what you've seen is that process be disruptive in part because of lack of content here in the fall, because of production stuff, but also because advertisers increasingly are pushing back on having that level of commitments., At the same time, their prior-year upfront deals, they've exercised a little use clause historically to be able to give notice and back out of significant portions of that prior commitment. And with that, we have seen them mix shift into OTT and into Roku in particular, because that's where the viewership is going. But it's also a more targeted, more measurable piece of advertising. And now that there's more scrutiny on budgets, having a much better sense of the ROI of your marketing is very, very appealing to marketers., Mark Mahaney, Thanks Steve. Shweta?, Shweta Khajuria, Okay, thanks Mark. Okay, so in the third quarter Roku monetized ad impressions were 90%. So just two questions are, how sustainable is this and is it a decent proxy for video ad revenue growth?, Steve Louden, Yes, thanks. Yes, if you kind of look back at the trend on Roku monetized video ad impressions, we do believe that that's our best directional indicator of how the ad business is doing. Before COVID for I think it was six or seven quarters in a row we talked about that, Roku monetized video ad impressions was growing at 100 plus percent, in Q2 you saw that decrease to 50% year-over-year as a lot of these marketers reflexively pull the emergency brake on a chunk of their ad spend, and then it bounced back in Q3 to 90% year-over-year., So it's up significantly relative between Q2 and Q3 year-over-year growth rates, but it's not quite back to the pace that it was growing pre-COVID. And so I'm encouraged that it's bouncing back. But it's not really quite back to normal, although certainly we do believe that we're outpacing the market significantly as folks lean into Roku. In terms of what's the proxy, I think we continue to be a premium CPM ad buy, but that's more than just five given the better ROI for that. So, we largely focus on moving advertising budgets over from traditional TV to Roku. And that's by far the biggest lever we can in terms of driving future growth and penetrating a massive opportunity as this $70 billion in the U.S. alone of TV advertising follows viewership streaming., Just one thing on that, just give you a comparison point. There's a pretty incredible stat. I think it's from Nielsen where for 18 to 34 year old to key demo, roughly half of their TV viewing in the quarter was streaming versus you look at the advertising budgets, and market data is a little harder to come by there. But you probably are in the mid single digit range for the percent of advertising budgets that have shipped over, ships over so. So even the fact that people are leaning more into OTT advertising, and Roku in particular, there's still like a massive gap where they greatly trail the amount of viewership that's moved over. And we think they need to right size that over time., Shweta Khajuria, Okay, thanks Steve. And then in the third quarter, there was also this one-time impact of revaluation of the business contracts which, if you want to quantify here, that'd be great. But if not, should we expect that, is that on an ongoing basis?, Steve Louden, Yes, we didn't quantify it in particular, but we did say that, the primary driver of strengthening the platform business was just kind of core bounce back of the advertising business relative to Q2 as well as very strong fundamentals in the content distribution side of the business. And then in addition, you have this, the fact that a lot of these 606 content distribution deal models were revalued up. As a reminder, we value these deals, not just content distribution deals, but all our material deals under 606 Accounting, every quarter and we have a portfolio of these deals, some go up in a quarter, some go down, a lot stay the same, really you get a spike like we experienced in Q3 when there's usually a common set of assumptions that change several deal models in one direction., And in our case, it was having a couple quarters worth of post-COVID related experience where we see accelerating active count base, we see higher propensity of consumers on SVOD subscriptions, TVOD has made a resurgence, as especially the premium movie rental has become a bigger, bigger thing. And so that caused us to value the deal models up and you get outsized portion of that in the quarter, you do that., In terms of just for historical reference, the last time we had a similar kind of outsized impact of the 606 deal model valuation exercise that we do each quarter was back in Q2 of 2019. So it does happen, not that often. We did mention in some color for Q4 that we didn't expect that to have a similar impact in Q4 of this year., Shweta Khajuria, Okay. Thanks Steve. Mark?, Mark Mahaney, Let me ask you two questions, Steve. One on OEM relations and one on international market expansion. This question, would you spend little time what the status of Roku is like with OEM today and both from the U.S. and in Europe?, Steve Louden, Yes, so. Hey Mark, you’re breaking up a little bit, but I think the question was around OEM relationships in sorry U.S. and international. Yes, in terms of the Roku TV program in general, things have been going very well, as a reminder, we started that program about five years ago. And so we've gone from no market share. While at the time, Android TV was already out there licensing, no operating system. So no market share five years ago to over a third of smart TVs that are sold running the Roku OS in the U.S. So we're number one, we passed Samsung as the top operating system in the U.S. within this last year, we announced in this quarter we believe we're now number one in Canada, as well in terms of smart TV OS sales. So very good progress on that, we continue to have a strategy where we want to become the default TV operating system., And we have a multi-OEM strategy, non-exclusive strategy, and we've been continuing to add OEMs in the U.S., and we've added a lot more OEMs internationally as well. And then we're kind of building out the offering for Roku TV, elsewhere. Yes, certainly TCL has been our historically biggest partner, they were kudos to them for the U.S. team, they went all in on Roku from day one, and that we helped them go from 20 something in the market to one of the top players. But we've also seen in the U.S., really strong growth over the last year with other partners as well, including Hisense, who's really leaned in to Roku, over the last year or two., Also, notably, Walmart's on brand, so their house brand of TVs, that's co-branded on Roku TV, and they've gained significant share in the market. So we've been leaning in heavily with Walmart, and then we're happy to see that we were able to extend the TCL deal internationally, we haven't access or we haven't announced any of those specific markets, because they'll start coming in 2021. But I think that speaks to being able to expand the relationship elsewhere. But at the same time, we've been growing internationally with other OEMs. In the last year, we've launched Roku TVs in Brazil, in the U.K., we've been gaining a lot of share to not only in Canada, but also in Mexico. So that speaks very well to the value proposition of the Roku program and the momentum we have., Shweta Khajuria, Mark, are you on mute?, Mark Mahaney, Yes, I'm having a hard time. OEM relationships actually, you just got an agreement. And next year, we'll see an ounce of specific country markets., Steve Louden, Yes, that's correct. The development cycle on those TV programs are generally let’s call them six to nine, maybe 12 months. And so we signed a deal, kind of mid to fall here this year. And so that means development cycle, so the TVs will start coming out in 2021 under that agreement., Shweta Khajuria, Let me follow-up on that. It's hard to hear Mark. So let me follow-up. What percent share does Roku have smart TVs and players outside the U.S., so as we think about Europe right now, and who else is a leader there?, Steve Louden, Yes, in terms of international, it depends on the market. But, as a reminder our international go-to-market is three phase right, we need to build scale, we need to drive engagement and then monetize. So a lot of these markets were pretty early. And so we're so focused on building scale. Ideally, we want to get players and TVs into markets we're in to have a critical mass of the value prop and get maximize our reach as quick as we can. So it really depends like I said Canada we're a leading platform, streaming platform, we're number one in TVs. We're growing fast players both U.S. or sorry both the Canada and U.K. more than doubled last year, I don’t have the specific market shares but certainly there are other players notably Google and Amazon that have international footprints., But importantly, we are heartened by the fact that the playbook that I described is three phase playbook and the competitive differentiators that we have in the U.S. we’ve got good proof points that that has significant traction in other markets as well. So the fact that we have lower barn costs, right that means we can build cheaper players and TVs and have an advantage over our competitors there. Our neutral positioning, the fact that we're free ad supported TV experts is more important in the rest of the world where they don't come to streaming with a high pay TV, high monthly build penetration that the U.S. does. So, we think the international markets still, the fact that they're significantly behind the U.S. in a lot of countries makes it an open playing field. And a lot of our advantages work nicely in other markets, and we were seeing good proof points of that., Shweta Khajuria, Okay, let's follow-up with Mark, are you back on?, Mark Mahaney, Go ahead, Shweta, I will ask next question., Shweta Khajuria, Okay, that sounds good. Let me ask you another question that came in from investors here in Smart TV, so incentives would consumers have to buy a Roku Smart, one smart TVs have fully penetrated in other words how differentiated is really from others in the market? And how will consumers identify that difference? And why would they choose a different smart TV?, Steve Louden, Yes, so I mean it's I think the key, why you would choose the Roku TV first and foremost is, it's a better value TV. And most importantly, the operating system is superior in terms of the UI is simple to use, we have historically had the most content. And the fact is, if you think about not just us saying that we're a better mousetrap, but the fact is on the player side, I think we've now CNET Editors’ Choice Awards in nine years in a row in the streaming category, our TVs are usually getting the top ratings as well, both from professional reviewers and strong consumer reviews., And so that just speaks to that, it's easy to use, the TVs are good value, because we can have our OEMs build them cheap, more cheaply. And so there's a lot of advantages to that, from a consumer standpoint, certainly, as Roku TVs grow and we become default home screen on more and more TVs, potentially the player opportunity can wane over time, but I think there's a lot more legs in players. If you look at the latest trends, there's a lot of unconnected TVs out there, there's a lot of smart TVs that are out there that don't have great OSS from other players. And so it's an easy thing to add a Roku player to a TV to upgrade VOS and a lot of people do., Shweta Khajuria, That makes sense. Let me switch gears to the Roku channel. So how do you view the opportunity with a Roku channel in terms of engagement and in terms of monetization? So let's start with engagement first, you've mentioned in the third quarter, right now you're reaching people or households that have 54 million people or so with a Roku channel? What does this mean in terms of the account ads that you can get for screening hours? And then I'll follow-up with monetization., Steve Louden, Yes, so good question. If you go back to our business model, or kind of drive scale, drive engagement and then monetize, the Roku channel does a very nice job of driving engagement, and then also enhancing Roku’s monetization. So, on the engagement side, we started the Roku channel about three years ago, we correctly identified that free ad supported content was an important part of many consumers streaming viewing habits, because there are a lot of folks are willing to trade-off getting free TV versus subscription TV, as long as we add, ad load and that experience is not too painful. And so that's really the promise we started the Roku channel., We were well ahead of the industry on that. And certainly, that the Roku channel has been growing very rapidly since its inception. And you mentioned the reach now that we're over 50 -- households with over 50 million people in reach. That's very significant reach but just as importantly, some other stats from Roku channel just to show the pace of growth it more than doubled its reach on a year-to-year basis. And more than doubled its streaming hours year-over-year, it was the fastest growing App of the Top 10 apps by streaming our growth., So it's just, it's becoming this more compelling aggregation point for a lot of content, especially free ad supported content. It's great consumer experience and then from a monetization side, it’s one of the advantages that as a platform owner is structurally we know who's watching, we have a first party consumer relationship with the folks because they've signed into the Roku account. If you're a standalone AVOD app, you don't know who's watching, a lot of people don't realize that. But you kind of have about as much data as you do in the traditional linear world, if you're standalone AVOD app, because you don't have any kind of authentication on the front-end of your AVOD app. Otherwise, that would kill a lot of your traffic., But we know who's watching in the Roku channel. And then we have the best proprietary data set on the platform. And so because we know who is watching and we have good data, we can have better content recommendation algorithms, hence that drives engagement. And just as importantly, on the monetization side, we can now sell that, that view of the library piece of content for a premium targeted CPM as opposed to a standalone AVOD app that has to sell that on run a network, or a lightly targeted Nielsen demo at a much lower CPM., So it gives us a very strong advantage. And over time, that flywheel I think is really is really enhancing the Roku channel growth, along with the fact that we're continuing to innovate in the Roku channel. We added an electronic program guide, we added a lot of linear live channels, which was great as you got into Election season, we've added new categories like kids and family over time, premium subscriptions, which is our SVOD service, or offerings within the Roku channel that we just keep putting more and more content and experiences into the Roku channel, which helps fuel growth as well., Shweta Khajuria, Okay, I'm going to try one more and then spin it over to you, Mark. Mark, can you hear us? Okay, okay. Okay, let me follow-up on Roku channel monetization. So you've referred to monetization has been denser on the Roku channel. So when you compare monetization on Roku within the Roku channel, and outside of the Roku channel, where you have a different level of control of different percentage of inventory? What do you mean by that? What do you mean that it is denser and can you compare the two please?, Steve Louden, Sure, yes, so what I mean by that is, if you think about any streaming out of Roku, you can have some hours that are more or less dense, right now, because we're early days still the move to streaming, we're focused on getting more active accounts, more scale, and just more general engagement, and then the monetization we're still early days. So we're not too particular like we just want the broader to format the broader trend. But when you look at within those streaming hours, if you got someone that says an existing Netflix subscription that we didn't sign up then and they spend more of their time in there, that's less dense monetization., Although we do monetize every user, whether it's from display ads or buttons on the remotes or, or other sponsorships or other things in there. But if you think about then AVOD, if it's a third-party app, we get the general models, we get a share of inventory, but the content owner is always going to have the majority of that inventory versus in the Roku channel, we have we control 100% of the ad inventory. And then we were able to we have a rev share agreement, but then that means that we have a denser amount of monetization than we would necessarily getting some inventory split from a third-party app. And so that's why I talked about some of these levels of density. So all things being equal, the Roku channel growing faster than average helps to be a tailwind for the fact that Roku monetized video ad impressions would grow faster than the overall streaming hours., Shweta Khajuria, Understood. That makes sense. So greater potential for higher gross profit dollars on the Roku channel than outside of Roku channel [indiscernible] being the same, gross margins being the same? Okay, Mark, I'm going to give to you., Mark Mahaney, Yes, hopefully you can hear me this time. Amazon and HBO Max reached the deal yesterday, how close is Roku to striking the deal with HBO Max?, Steve Louden, Yes, I don't have any specific update on now. We generally don't talk about where we're at in deals. But yes, we continue to talk to folks and our goal is to have all content on there. But similar to the Peacock situation, we're not always first. But we've got a very good idea about what market is and how much value we can create. We've got the biggest, most engaged user base in the U.S. And so hopefully we can get a deal done. And then we can use our industry leading audience development tools to help build audience for new services., Mark Mahaney, Do you plan to open up more and more of your ad inventory to outside the demand side platforms like the Trade Desk?, Steve Louden, Well, for our Roku media, we saw that direct either through our direct sales force or through the OneView platform. So we don't use outside parties as a demand source for us in terms of putting our inventory, say in a third-party DSP auction or marketplace, we do have connections to third-party DSPs as well as other players in the ecosystem, whether it's SSPs or measurement partners. And usually how that works is advertisers or their agencies would come to us and they would purchase Roku inventory. And they say they would like to fulfill some of that via a third-party DSP or some other instance. And then so we have connections to that to facilitate that. But we're focused on selling our inventory ourselves, for the most part., Mark Mahaney, Could you talk about the degree of concentration in Roku platform streaming hours, at the time of the IPO was a pretty substantial concentration towards Netflix, Amazon, YouTube, over the last two or three years is that concentration held constant decreased or increased?, Steve Louden, Yes, in terms of some of the things that we've noted publicly in our filings, over time, Netflix continues to grow. They're the number one app on the platform. But as a comparison point, when I started at Roku, about five years ago, they were roughly 50% of the streaming and now they're under a third. And usually they tick down over time, as other players grow around them. Certainly, you've seen new entrants come on to into the streaming world, over the last year or two that have made waves. So most notably, Disney Plus, so that's diversified some of the top viewing, certainly the Roku channel didn't exist three years ago or roughly three years ago, and so that's now a Top 10 app. And like we said, last quarter is the fastest growing., So there are some new entrants there, it does move around. But in general, the ecosystem is filling out as more companies shift their focus to streaming., Mark Mahaney, Last question, Steve, this is niche one for you, the biggest challenge that you focus on in terms of maintaining growth rates over the next year or two?, Steve Louden, I think there’s a couple lenses on that. I mean, I do think, externally the biggest opportunity has always been the TV ad market and moving these dollars over. And like I said, the viewership is way ahead of that. So the biggest single prize that we can continue to do is push on getting these ad budgets to follow the viewership over to OTT and to Roku and particular in certainly innovations we have around like the OneView platform, things like the recently announced Kroger Shopper Data, new performance structures like the incremental audience guarantee, they can all help that., But that's certainly the biggest piece and as I mentioned COVID, as a disruptor, I think has broken down some of the friction for that. So we'll see where that goes. But certainly that that's always been our biggest single opportunity, although there's great growth vectors on international on building Roku TV share, as well as the Roku channel for both the monetization and engagement platform, like we talked about. Internally, I spend a lot of time worrying about how we invest in the scalability and the efficiency of the operations of the business. And so that's something we continue to invest, it's a good problem to have when you're growing top line revenue as fast as we are and building headcount is very fast, but obviously, that creates a lot of work internally to keep up and make sure you're scalable. So I spend a lot of time thinking about that as well., Mark Mahaney, Okay, Steve, thank you very much, Steve Louden, CFO of Roku. Thanks for joining us today stay safe, stay healthy. Hope to see you in the New Year and thanks everybody for participating this afternoon., Steve Louden, Yes, thanks everybody for joining on the call and thanks to Mark and Shweta for hosting. Appreciate it. Stay well everyone., Shweta Khajuria, Thanks., Question-and-Answer Session"

23718,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4389820-csx-corporations-csx-ceo-james-foote-presents-stephens-annual-investment-conference,James Foote - President and Chief Executive Officer,"Justin Long - Stephens, Justin Long, This is Justin Long from Stephens. I want to welcome everyone to the next fireside chat with CSX. Thanks for joining us today., We're really excited to have Jim Foote, CEO, presenting on behalf of the company. As a reminder, for the fireside chat, I'll be moderating the questions. If you have any questions that you'd like to ask, you can e-mail me at justin.long@stephens.com. We've got about 45 minutes scheduled and I'll fill in as many as I can., So, Jim, thanks for being here. Really appreciate your support at this event, even if it's virtual. I'm going to kick it to you to get things started off with just an update on the business on how things are trending quarter-to-date and then we'll dive into some of the questions. And I think you might be on mute., James Foote, Technology at its finest., Justin Long, There we go. We're set now. Thanks., James Foote, Oh, geez. All of that, I still screwed it up. What can I say? I probably would have done the same thing if we're in person, so I don't feel too bad., Great to see you. Yes, we were just saying, I wish we were in Nashville together and with everyone in the room together, but maybe next year. How are things going? Well, tough, tough. Better, obviously, everybody knows things are better than it was, with the business just coming around. We're doing well, trying to keep the railroad running to a high-level of service and efficiency, and just trying to get through this with our customers and everyone else, taking care of our employees. And I think we're hopefully on track to get out of this mess as a country soon., Justin Long, And I know you didn't provide much guidance in terms of the near-term in the fourth quarter. But I'm just curious from a high-level, when you look at the trends in the business quarter-to-date, volume, service, operating leverage, et cetera, have things kind of played out in line with your expectations? Or anything that you would call out as outperforming or underperforming?, James Foote, Well, based on my personal opinion is, I think, things have come back stronger and faster than I had originally anticipated. I know you play a lot of golf and every once in a while you hit a good drive on a par five and you go over the sprinkler head and you're about 300 yards out and it says are you kidding?, It's kind of like what I look -- what I see when I look into the crystal ball to try and tell me what next month or next week or the next day is going to be like, that's the answer I get. But I think everything has come back clearly faster than what I personally had expected. And that's a good thing., The consumer economy has, I think, outperformed everyone's expectations. But we had two differing economic environments going into this with a very, very sluggish for over a year period on the industrial economy and the consumer economy doing very well. So it's not unexpected that consumer economy came back quicker and faster. Automotive came back stronger and faster than what I had expected. And so those are good signs. The economy, I think, is resilient. The economy was relatively strong going in. And I think we're – hopefully, we get back to where we were soon., Justin Long, Maybe building on what you said about the consumer, there's obviously this restocking that needs to occur. Based on the conversations that you've had with your customers, how long do you think that restocking process could take? Is that through the end of the first quarter? Or is it longer? What are your thoughts around the timing of that?, James Foote, Well, it's still everybody – everyone, I think, is expecting it to go into the first quarter. We're kind of going into -- we're going into peak with an unusual demand for e-commerce, the outlook in terms of the port projections and those sort of things from an international perspective, are – look like it's going to – should absent some sort of an unusual occurrence globally, continue into the first quarter. And I think that our opinion are not inconsistent with everybody else in the intermodal world., Justin Long, And then on the industrial side of the equation, are you seeing more green shoots on that front? And as we think about next year, do you think there's potential for industrial to outpace consumer? And I would assume if that happens, the next implications for your business would be pretty good. So I would love to get your thoughts around that?, James Foote, No. Again, I don't think that we expect the industrial economy to overtake the consumer economy in any -- in the near-term. But we were, I think, we were coming off of a relatively weak base. You have to go back and it seems like ancient history now, but remember what was going on with all the tariff issues and what the implications of that were on the industrial economy. And so we'll have to, let's hopefully, we can get back to where that that relatively weak base was. And then whether its stimulus or whether there are other factors that play that caused the industrial economy to rebound at rates above what we have traditionally seen, we'll have to just wait and see., Justin Long, And thinking about peak season, I think, the expectation across the board is, it would be strong, just given the strength we've seen in the consumer and the freight market. I'm assuming that's played out, but we'd love to kind of get your thoughts on what you've seen there. And, more importantly, just from a service perspective, given things have bounced back, you made the point earlier at a pace that's greater than you anticipated peak strong, how is the service business held up through all of that?, James Foote, I think that the service has held up extremely well. It can always be better. We would always like to reach perfection. But the ability of the rail industry and CSX, in particular, to be able to pivot and respond in the manner in which we did, I think, says a lot about the transformation of the railroads to be much more nimble and be able to respond to the ups and downs and gyrations that, in the past, would have created a lot more service challenges for our customers than what we're seeing right now., Justin Long, And I think at the end of the last quarter from a trip plan compliance perspective, you said that you were around 80% for carload, around 90% for intermodal. When you look at those numbers here in the fourth quarter, have you seen them improve at all? Have they been stable? Is there any color you can give us there?, James Foote, I think that's a good range, still not where we want them to be. I think I said we'll get back to where we were and we'll get -- we'll improve from there. We're not immune. Our employees are not immune from COVID. Sometimes I think based upon the number of cases we should have developed herd immunity by now. But we're, like everybody else, we're long, long, long ways away from that., So we have our day-to-day challenges on parts of the railroad. And – but I think we're working through that the best we can. We expect to meet our customers' demands for peak. But again, it's a challenging environment and we have to balance the needs of our employees, our workforce, our customers, and the communities every single day., Justin Long, Maybe we can shift to truckload conversions and the opportunity there. I know, that's something that you've highlighted repeatedly over the course of the last few earnings calls. But could you just talk about what you're seeing today in terms of truckload conversions? Are you seeing the pace of that activity accelerate here in the third and fourth quarter and if so in what areas?, James Foote, I've been talking about truckload conversions probably for 20 years. The beauty of the call it scheduled railroad model or whatever you want to refer to it as, is the enormous improvement in the service reliability that we're able to generate and the benefits that that have primarily for our carload shippers., And so truck converting business back from the highway that in more cases than not at one point in time in history was probably moved in a railcar, is a huge priority for us because you couldn't compete in that market when your service was not reliable enough that our customer could not trust us to get his product to his customer., So yes, we're continuing to grind that out and continuing to convert traffic back to rail and these are customers that today have a plant or a factory someplace, where on one side of their plant, they have rail doors, and on the other side of the plant, they have truck doors. And so they're used to shipping by rail. And so getting in there and proving to them with the new lanes or lanes they haven't used rail on for a long time is we're making progress. But we have to prove ourselves as simple as that. This is not something where you can just go flip a switch., Justin Long, And you've talked about that market share percentage for rail, looking at the transportation market as a whole, it's a very small piece of the pie, less than 10%. But when you look specifically at your customers, how do you typically see that? Or what do you typically see in terms of that percentage of their freight that's allocated towards rail? And any thoughts like, on average, on where that could go? Because I know this is something that you've been pushing for a while, you've been pitching this conversion story. So just wondering if you can put some more numbers around that?, James Foote, Well, probably in a customer location, and you have to take it by location, because you have to take it by commodity. But in certain commodities where we think we're -- we historically have thought we were doing a really good job, and you go in and you talk to the logistics manager in-charge of the meeting that transportation needs across their network of mills, or plants or whatever it may be., And we're sitting there, I'd say, 50%, 51% 52%, and I say how much of that should be moved by rail? And how much would you like to move by rail? And he just looked at me like I'm an idiot, and they go like all of it. We'd like to ship everything by rail, if we could. You're substantially cheaper. And the reason that that business migrated away from the railroads over the years was the fact that your service reliability just didn't meet our needs., They now see. They now have not only as our service dramatically improve, but we offer the tools available to them, just like the trucker does, so they can track and trace their equipment. They can keep track of things. They know what's going on. Visibility and not arrogance on the part of the railroad management that says, “Hey, when it gets there, it gets there.” And so we're earning that business back. And is it going to be - are we going to go from 52 to 88 in a year? No. Is 88 something we should strive for? Absolutely., And I'd like to prove the guy right that we should handle 100% of it. But obviously, there are certain commodities in certain lanes that is always going to be truck. And that's the nature of the beast. But we gave this business away. We gave this business up, and it's our obligation and our responsibility to figure out a way to get it back., Justin Long, And obviously, we know in intermodal, there's an opportunity for conversion. But on the general merchandise side, it's significant as well. Within general merchandise, what are the commodities where you see that the biggest addressable market for truckload conversions?, James Foote, Again, it's in the business that we handle today, whether it's lumber, paper, pulp, steel, a metal, aggregates, things that -- these are commodities that we move today that we have, maybe historically not, number one, historically didn't have a good service product; number two, historically didn't invest in the equipment necessary to move it. If we did have equipment, that was probably substandard. And so by working with the customers, we can earn that business back. And that's the primary -- that's a primary focus of ours., Justin Long, And do you feel like the biggest hang-up for your customers converting freight is just time and people saying that, we were in an environment where the freight market was weak, rail volumes were down, and yes service was good, but volumes were down. But now that rail volumes have improved, the services held up pretty well. We could see an inflection point in the conversion story as we look into 2021. Is that a fair way of thinking about it?, James Foote, I think you'll see incremental gains quarter-to-quarter, year-to-year above historical averages. But I mean again, if we were growing our carload business, let's just say at 2%, it's not going to go to 7%. We can go from 2% to 2.5% to 3.5%, I think those are the kinds of grinded out blocking and tackling kinds of results that we can look for. So we can grow. Again, if we were historically good, let's put it in perspective, in the carload business, if we were historically shrinking we need to turn that around and we have. So we've gotten from historically shrinking getting smaller year-after-year to now getting a stabilizing and beginning to grow year-after-year. And that is our strategy on the carload business., On the intermodal side, we have a really fantastic, fantastic franchise serving a ton of customers with; I think unparalleled service levels with capacity to grow. And so both of those, both carload and intermodal create a lot of opportunity and potential for us. And our channel partners talk about the opportunities that they see to move more and more things to rail, and whether that be cost savings associated with that, whether that be environmental benefits that are motivating shippers who want to move more and more things more environmentally friendly, whether it be highway congestion, the traditional challenges that our primary competitors face, which is lack of drivers, problems with insurance. The trucking industry seems to be more plagued by challenges year-after-year-after-year-after-year than even the railroad industry does. So but we've changed our mindset, we've changed our focus, we've changed the way we want to do business. And I think that -- and again the opportunities there are very good for us., Justin Long, On the point about being environmentally friendly and the focus on ESG, is that something that you feel is driving the conversion of freight from truck to rail today? Or is that something that is still on the horizon?, James Foote, I think depending upon the company you're dealing with one of our customers that we're dealing with, they have all had different, different philosophies about that for years, this is not new. There were various customers out there that set targets for themselves. There were customers a long time ago, that were planting grass on the roof of their buildings because they wanted to be more environmentally focused. And those were parts of the conversations that we've had for years, and so it's not that they didn't recognize that we were more environmentally friendly. It's not like this was a really a Shazam moment where it goes like, oh, my God, you guys burn only a quarter at a diesel compared to all the trucks that are on iron. Man, I'd be but then the conversation went, yes, but you got to get it there on time. I'd love to use it, but I'm not going to put myself out of business just because I can say, I have a lower carbon footprint., So now I'm coming in with comparable truck like service. Yes, it's a big factor. And it's something that number one we're proud of as a company, and especially as a company that's kind of leading in some of these areas. And so we'd be crazy not to be pitching it and not to be selling it. And then there are a lot of -- there are a lot of customers out there, there are more and more and more customers and will continue to be more and more customers all the time that are focused on ways in which they can benefit the environment. Transportation is a big spend for a lot of our customers. If they can benefit the environment at the same time, they're definitely going to do that., Justin Long, Maybe shifting to the excess capacity in the network today. So I did a fireside chat earlier with UP. One of the things they really emphasized was train-lengths and a continued opportunity on that front. And I think that's a theme we're seeing in the industry as a whole right now as volumes are coming back, they're getting folded into existing trains, or blending trains. Anyway to help us understand the remaining runway on train-lengths and if that opportunity is much different between general merchandise and intermodal, just curious if there's more of an opportunity in one of those segments?, James Foote, Well there's opportunity in both segments. The challenge is to a degree on intermodal train-length. You got to make sure you got terminal capacity to handle the train to be able to meet the source to turn the train to get the boxes on, get the boxes off. So we don't want to just run long trains for the sake of running long trains and then have them get congested at the terminals., Again, we have to make sure we do this smart because we don't want to jeopardize service just to make sure you got long train out there. We don't get paid bonus points for running long trains. But we do get paid is providing a good quality customer service product. And if we can do that more efficiently, we can help our customers be more competitive. But we're always looking at, we have capacity to run longer trains, we're continually running longer trains. But at the same time, we need to make sure that we keep our service metrics in line with where our customers expect them to be. And as I said at the very beginning, make sure that we continue to improve on those service metrics over time., Justin Long, And just strategically as you think about growth, is there more of an emphasis in general merchandise versus intermodal or would you say that you're kind of spending an equal amount of time on, you're talking to customers about converting freight in both of those segments?, James Foote, Two-thirds of my franchise is merchandise. I spent two-thirds of my time on merchandise., Justin Long, Is there [ph] another?, James Foote, Mark and Mark does too. So it's a big opportunity for us. It's a big focus for us. You guys look at the revenue per unit, the difference between the two. Oh my god, if we grow intermodal faster than merchandise, real horrible because our mixes all screwed up. So it's a big part of our business. It's a very, very good part of our business., And merchandise, and it lends itself again, when you roll out, when you change your operating philosophy and you begin to eliminate all these unnecessary touches across the network, think I mean, we eliminated all this unnecessary touches. We don't own intermodal trains. So, guess who benefited from, we don't have coal trains. Guess who benefited from the overall service improvements and efficiencies when we change the operating network, Shazam service levels of the merchandise business improved dramatically. So it's a big, big, big focus of ours. Clearly, well we don't want people to misinterpret that that we don't like intermodal or something like that. No, that's a big, big, big part of our business, too. It happens to be a smaller part of our business., Justin Long, And your Eastern competitor has actually announced some lanes, new lanes in intermodal. I'm wondering if that's something that we could see in CSX's network as well. I know a big focus of yours for some time was to right-size that intermodal business and essentially trim it down. But are we to a point where that that process has been complete? And now we might actually see some lanes reopen or how do we think about that?, James Foote, Well, I think you have to look at the overall economic environment and its dynamic, the world changes. Volume growth in certain commodity areas, it change over time, ports sizes, the ports go up, go down, people want to go from the East -- the East coast to the center part of the country versus the west to the center part of the country. It's a dynamic environment., What we did when we reengineered the intermodal network was to eliminate the multiple handling of containers as they moved across our network, because it wasn't necessarily that the traffic didn't want to go from point A to point B. But we were taking it from point A to point A1 to point A2 to point A3 before we got to B., And it was a question of the costs associated with trying to do that. So basically artificially create growth. That's what we eliminated. There was always been a focus if there's enough volume in the lane that has density where we want, we think we can offer a product. Clearly, we look at it. So I wouldn't be surprised if we open up shipping from different locations because the market grows to a degree it could be, people are building distribution facilities in places where they would didn't exist before. People are putting in Big Box stores in places where they didn't exist before., Nashville, a couple years ago was a different city than it is today. So is it on -- would it be unreasonable to think like, oh, maybe we should go to Nashville? Well, geez, are you guys opening up lanes? No, there's a new market there. We want to get into the market. Guess what we're in the transportation business. People are moving goods from to a place where they didn't move them before. So obviously we would look at those markets. And if it made sense, and we could compete, that's what we do., Justin Long, Thinking about the pricing environment as we get into next year, obviously the truckload market has improved capacities tight there, the service product for CSX is strong. So it feels like there should be some nice momentum. When you think about pricing in general merchandise versus intermodal, do you think the pricing trends will look similar into 2021? Or with intermodal, I know it's a bit more price sensitive. Just wondering if you -- we could see a kind of divergence in the trends on pricing?, James Foote, Well, in general, first of all we don't talk about pricing too much. But in general again we think that we've priced to the value of our service. And to the extent that our service gets better, we should be able to price more. We don't look at the dial-a-truck prices on an hourly basis to try and figure out what the market spot price is. That's really not the nature of the way we do business. We have long-term relationships with customers. And so, price increases, it will, should continue to be consistent with what they've been over the last couple of years at CSX., Justin Long, And are you pretty pleased with your IMC relationships right now, maybe you could just talk about the service that you're seeing out there with those companies that you work with as well?, James Foote, Oh, gosh. Our relationships with IMCs they are absolutely best buddies. We work together. We work together as partners in a -- to provide a joint transportation product, that's simply what it is, starts on a truck and ends on a truck. And if they can use rail, they use rail. And by working together, we hope that between the two of us we can grow together. That's the relationship. And then we argue about who gets what piece of the pie, simple as that., So yes, I think as our service levels, clearly, we had some difficult times with some of our IMCs as were just talking about, when we were somewhat changing and rationalizing whatever term you want to use, how we did business in certain markets, it was disruptive. But I think we're clearly back on a very good footing with all of our customers and we want to grow together., And we want to develop these new markets that we were talking about. And we want to be bigger players in e-commerce and developing products that can be competitive in these marketplaces., So I think we're really, as I said earlier, they have challenges, whether it be drivers or whatever it might be GAEIR. If the government regulation is changing where within, they have to do business. So I think they lean on us to get the job done. And to a certain degree, we lean on them to help us get done in the first mile, last mile, what we don't do. So it’s a good -- it’s a good and healthy relationship. I think, look at the volume growth in intermodal right now. We're doing things -- we're doing things from a service standpoint to help them serve their customers in a way I think that has to be -- they have to be pleased and surprised about how we've been able to respond., Justin Long, Right. And maybe shifting the call. I know the view from CSX is longer-term, that market will continue to be pressured. But it sounds like there's some structural changes that you've been implementing this year. And I know you probably don't want to go into the details around all of that. But as we look into next year and beyond on the heels of those changes, you've made within the coal franchise, is it reasonable to expect that your coal business can outperform the market going forward?, James Foote, Which market domestic, export?, Justin Long, I guess both., James Foote, Again there's a huge challenges in both things. I think as we have changed -- we've changed. CSX is a changed different company that it was a few years ago, we view things slightly different. Not just from a service standpoint, but from a marketing strategy standpoint as well. We have new people in key roles and just about every key role in the organization. We have new people with different thoughts on how to do things differently than the way it's always been done. I think we have a much clearer vision of the global markets. We recognized our -- the U.S. coal industries place in the global markets. And our challenge is to leverage what we've done on our service and cost side is to prove that we're a reliable source for export coal and again align ourselves with expanding or changing markets., But at the end of the day, we're kind of at the mercy of global demand, global steel demand, global demand for electricity, price of gas in Russia and all those kinds of things, that we don't have a lot of control over., And then on the domestic side, on the electric utility side, that's going to continue to be a challenge for us. I don't know if -- I don't know what natural gas prices are going to be a year or two from now. Whether or not coal is going to continue to remain reasonably competitive, but our challenge in both markets here is to make sure that we -- we're forward-thinking we understand the dynamics of the market and change appropriately. So we can meet the needs from a service standpoint and understand the changing dynamics, so we can adapt and continue to participate in which is still a very, very good piece of our business for as long as we possibly can., Justin Long, I know the cash flow profile of the business is something that CSX's really been focused on highlighting, and I think it's an important part of the story. Last quarter, you authorized the buyback the $5 billion buyback incrementally. Now that we're through the Election, we have some data points on a vaccine, is it reasonable to expect you to get more aggressive putting that buyback program to work? Or how do you think about the pace of allocating that program?, James Foote, Well, we didn't pull out or suspend our share buyback because of a change in philosophy, or a lack of available cash to be used for that purpose. We suspended our share buyback because with all of the uncertainty, it was just the prudent thing to do. We, a while ago, told everybody we were back in the market. But being more opportunistic and so I think that's -- I think that's the case going forward. That's our philosophy. We generate a lot of cash flow. I think you should all recommend and look at companies based upon their free cash flow versus their earnings per share. I'd be very, very pleased if everybody did that., And then, so our first call on cash, obviously is to maintain the railroad which we're doing a really good -- really, really good job at. We're spending more money to improve and maintain the railroad. What we're doing more in terms of what we're installing in terms of rail ties ballast, et cetera than has historically been done at CSX. But the kind of philosophy in terms of efficiency that we apply to running the trains is what we do to apply to how we install a rail and tie, so we get more done for less., And so first thing make sure we keep the railroad in great shape, be in a position to serve our customers' needs, and then after that it's, invest in opportunities to grow. If they have any -- the appropriate level of return that makes sense. And trust me trying to get $1 out of Kevin is tough. But he continues to find extremely high return projects first to investing. And after that, as we've always said our philosophy has been then we return that cash in some way, shape or form to our shareholders. And so nothing's changed. We have the authority. And we'll be there doing that at various different degrees as we go-forward., Justin Long, On the topic of capital allocation, there have been headlines around Pan Am; you guys have addressed that, so I'm not going to ask about it. But I did want to ask just bigger picture about Class 1 mergers and M&A and just coming out of this pandemic, knock on wood, have your views around that changed at all? I mean, if that's something that CSX would be interested in pursuing in the years ahead?, James Foote, I don't see anything near-term. You can never say what's going to happen down the road. But I think I said in the last earnings call, I think there's a changed mindset in the industry right now, in terms of how to work. An exciting time, really exciting time for all the individual railroad companies, the industry, our customers in a way we're working together and collaborating more with a focus on service not just on our own companies, but jointly, 50% of the traffic either originates or terminates on connecting railroads. So, we can have really, really great service. But if the -- if our connecting partner doesn't, then so much, so what our service really isn't any good., So I think this common mindset that you see across the industry by not only -- not only the Class 1s but the regional players as well bodes well for opportunities for us to get some of those, get a lot of those synergies that's traditionally the mindset, I think the railroad managements would have been. Well, the only way we can -- the only way we can get those synergies is by having us controlling the single line move and us consolidating our G&A into one, we can do this, we can do that, we'll get better., I think we can get a lot of those values without having to resort to going down the M&A route, not to say that's not a logical approach, somebody might differ with me. I just think that there's a tremendous amount of things that we can do., And the more and more, like I say the more and more we become likeminded in the way we approach the business, the better it is for everyone. Clearly, the railroads run better today with a smaller number of railroads than they did back in 1980, when there were 61 or 62 Class 1 railroads just because you want to go back to that day. I mean, it was just jointed dysfunctional. And the railroads kept losing market share, market share, market share, market share because they didn't run very well. So we've got ourselves in a good spot right now. We're focusing on the right things to do. And we can continue, I believe, to find opportunities in synergies as we move forward that traditionally, I think most people thought the only way to get this by merging., Justin Long, Maybe as we close with one last question, the Election is now behind us, I guess depending on the top two. But any kind of high-level thoughts on how the outcome of the Election could impact your business, whether it's regulation or anything else we should be mindful of looking into next year and beyond?, James Foote, Not into next year. I mean, we've gone through; we do this all the time. The railroads have been around forever. So I guess we'd have to go back and see what the change was during -- from the Truman administration to whatever administration. So we've been through this all the time, sometimes there's more interest in it., I think the biggest thing from any industry, and it's probably not just the roads, the biggest thing from anybody who's regulated and has a regulator is there is going to be a more of a focus on having more regulation on how we run the business, is it going to be less. But we get through all of that like everybody else does. And so I don't see anything, I don't see anything that it would dramatically change the way we run the company, whether or not when the new administration whenever that might be or whoever that might be, comes to power., Justin Long, Well, Jim, I think we're out of time. So I'm going to leave it at that. But it's great to see you. I really appreciate your time today and wish you the best of luck headed into year-end and everyone that dialed-in, thanks for joining us. I hope you have a great rest of the week. Enjoy the conference. And we'll talk soon., James Foote, Thank you very much for the time., Justin Long, Thanks, everyone., Question-and-Answer Session"

My name is David Vernon I am Bernstein’s airline analyst and transport analyst. We are kicking off our contributions to this year’s ODC with American Airlines. Vasu Raja, Chief Revenue Officer, the IR team and Vasu’s, predecessor in revenue team is with us here, They are going to kick us off with a little bit of prepared remarks and then, we will go into some Q&A. , Before we begin, note that on your screens you should see a Pigeonhole link for questions that you want to promote or demote and ask us work into the conversation, as well as a Procensus survey which we can use to incorporate some real-time feedback into the events. , So, once again, I’d like to welcome you all. Thank you for joining us. And I hand it over to Vasu to kick us off with some opening remarks. , Vasu Raja, Hey, thanks a lot. Good morning, everyone and thanks for having me. First off, it’s clear this continues to be an incredibly challenging time for our entire industry, our team and our customers. At American, we’ve taken actions to significantly improve our liquidity and are making decisions so we can manage through the pandemic and position our airline for when demand returns., As we look across the competitive landscape, there is no network better positioned than American’s. To be clear, our network is designed for our customers who want to go right now. Our hubs across the Sun Belt and Charlotte, Miami, Dallas, Fort Worth, and Phoenix are best positioned to capture current customer demand and we’ve seen that throughout this pandemic. , In fact, in the third quarter, one out of every three passengers flying in the United States chose American. That speaks volumes to the value of American’s position in the current climate. , Secondly, we have the best short haul international network with the largest presence in Mexico and the Caribbean. Demand for this region has been strong and based on current trends, we expect our fourth quarter revenue for this region to remain strong, achieving as much as 70% of 2019 levels. , Third, we are taking this opportunity to be creative and take a fresh look at future opportunities, while finding smart ways to strengthen our hubs in key markets. The future of aviation must include strong partnerships and American leads in this regard, whether it’s our recently announced partnerships with Alaska and JetBlue; our equity investment in China Southern for our joint business agreements with leading airlines like IAG, JAL and Qantas we are raising the competitive bar on providing customers with better choices and world-class products. , In addition to being nimble when it comes to our network, we’ve continued to enhance the customer experience. Recently we’ve removed changed fees for most of flying - eliminated fees on award tickets, extended mileage validity. We’ve created partnerships to establish pre-flight testing programs, so customers are more able to easily visit destinations like Hawaii and the Caribbean. , Our clean commitment is industry-leading and multiple studies show it’s extremely safe to fly in the era of COVID-19. I have been very – I have been flying multiple times every week and I see it, the level of cleaning, the safety measures, and the diligence from our team and customers is truly incredible. , Most importantly, in the face of unprecedented adversity and uncertainty, the American team is doing amazing work to take care of our customers and each other. We are tremendously proud of what they continue to do each and every day. , In closing, we remain in an uncertain demand environment. So we are focused on being flexible and nimble in all parts of our organization. And we are committed to making sure our customers feel safe and comfortable and how flexibility when they travel. We know we still have a long road ahead of us, but our entire team remains fully engaged and focused on not just getting through this pandemic, but making sure we are prepared for when demand returns. , With that, I am happy to take any questions you might have. And again, thanks for having me., Question-and-Answer Session"

23703,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4389745-t-mobile-us-inc-tmus-presents-bcg-and-new-street-research-5g-conference-transcript,Neville Ray - President of Technology Officer,"Jonathan Chaplin - New Street Research, Jonathan Chaplin, Good morning all, and thanks for joining us. I’m Jonathan Chaplin from New Street Research. I’m joined by [indiscernible], the Senior Partner from BCG., Neville Ray needs no introduction to this audience, the world’s most recognizable CTO, actually, I should say the world’s most recognizable President of Technology. I think T-Mobile has two avenues for value creation. First, they are going to capture about $7 billion to $8 billion in annual synergies. My number, not Neville’s. Second, they are going to capture at least 500 basis points of market share over the course of the next few years. That will deliver another $7 billion to $8 billion in EBITDA., Neville is at the heart of both value drivers. He is leading the most significant part of the integration process, the network integration. And he is building the network advantage that is going to drive the market share gains. And so Neville, you are on the hook for a lot. Thanks for joining us today., Neville Ray, We are delighted to be here, Jonathan, and look forward to the conversation. Yes, lots to do here at the New T-Mobile. But we are sure at it. So a lot to talk about., Jonathan Chaplin, Neville, first, I just want to kick off with a sort of a broad-ranging question that might actually not be entirely fair in that it is not network related. So you have built a phenomenal position, 280 million pops covered with low-band 5G. By the end of the year, $100 million with 2.5. - that is just nine-months after close. What do Mike and Matt have to do to make consumers aware of the network you have built? How do you change perception? And what is the organization thinking in strategy? How does it need to evolve now that you are no longer a scrappy underdog, but a network leader., Neville Ray, Well, thanks, Jonathan, great question. I mean, I like to think we are still scrappy right, that is T-Mobile. We are always going to be fighting away and an entrepreneurial scrappy business. But to your question, I mean thank you for the kind of the recognition on our network progress. And we have come a hell of a long way inside a very short period of time post the close of the transaction with Sprint on April one., And to your question on how do we market and tell the story, Jonathan. I mean I want it to be understood that we are marketing and telling our 5G story now. And the next chapter in the book is soon to be opened or read. And it is important that folks understand the coverage leadership that you referenced in the back part of the question there., If you look at 5G leadership in the U.S. today, I mean there is no doubt, right, about where T-Mobile is. And we have been building out our low band, our coverage layer on 5G for many months now, for several years, in fact, using 600 megahertz spectrum that we secured in an auction not too long ago, an $8 billion investment for the company., And we have been rolling that out for some time every radio we put out is dual mode, it supports both LTE and 5G, and we have been leveraging that clean kind of fallow spectrum for that rollout for some time. And we launched nationwide 5G about this time it was December of last year., And now our competition has kind of flipped, and we will talk later in more detail, I’m sure, about AT&T and specifically Verizon. And they have now flipped to kind of this low-band nationwide story. And Verizon very recently announced their nationwide footprint., But I think it is important folks to understand there is a huge difference. I mean you referenced the 280 million pops for us on low-band by the end of the year, with 270 million now. But the geographic coverage, Jonathan, we are at 1.4 million square miles. Now this is a big country, right., But I mean we have covered almost half of it already with our 5G footprint. And obviously, where there is the vast majority of the U.S. population lives. That number in Verizon terms is about 400,000 square miles based on the recently released and then re-released and upgraded coverage map. So that is a gap of a million square miles. It is almost four times in terms of the differential. AT&T, about 600,000 square miles., And so why I mention that? I mean I think it is important, a lot of folks opening up that iPhone 12 box right now. And they are going to be pretty disappointed on those other networks in contracts - and start contrast to T-Mobile. They are not even going to see a 5G icon. They might see a 5G E icon from AT&T., We have been so panicked about low-band and 5G coverage for so long. They kind of head faked and try to head fake their customers into believing they were getting 5G when they are on an LTE network. So I mean, this has been an interesting story for some time., But long story short, we are out there. And we have been messaging our coverage story and our coverage advantage. And of course, also the combination with Sprint, if you look at our advertising right now. And so we are telling that coverage story, making sure folks understand that it is a differentiated proposition., Now that said, and I will shut up in a minute, I promise. I do look at this kind of crazy season that we are seeing. I mean the Verizon advertising is everywhere. And Jonathan, I mean, you have written others have written. There is a lot of promise in that Verizon advertising, about a breadth of 5G experience in this Ultra Wideband thing., But quite frankly, customers are just not finding and not seeing. And so I think they are really over their skis, right, promising a 5G experience, which, quite frankly, for the vast, vast majority of their customers does not exist in the U.S. today., And at T-Mobile, we are not going to do that. We have never done that in our past. We have been edgy on our advertising. But I think Verizon is in a difficult position, and I think it will come back to haunt them as their customers buy into iPhones and other 5G products now, and they see and open that box and get the experience behind it and can’t find Ultra Wideband in most geographies and areas, even where it is advertised. We can talk some more on that., So for us, we want to manage customer expectations carefully. And as you read you referenced, the big change, the next chapter in the book is our mid-band, 2.5 gigahertz spectrum rollout. That program is going really well. I will repeat your numbers in case people miss them, but I will give you a quick update., So we announced the earnings 30 million pops. We are just under 37 million today. So we will be about 40 million by the end of the week. 100 million by the end of the year and 200 million for the end of 2021., And that is where folks are going to see a really differentiated, high-capacity, high-speed performance layer. And they are going to see it from T-Mobile with broad coverage and ubiquitous coverage very, very fast., And as we get that footprint into a material shape as we close out this quarter, then we are going to go talk about it. And we will manage customer expectations. And Matt and the team are lining up all the materials we need to not just talk about that externally from an advertising perspective, but to make sure the discussion in our retail channels and our care channels is really vibrant and robust because you are right, this is our time., We have spent a long time leveling the playing field on coverage, LTE coverage with Verizon and AT&T. That was kind of our last seven years kind of Un-carrier one. And now we are in this position to move ahead and jump ahead of Verizon and AT&T with a very different 5G strategy, rolling out mid-band pace on top of a very mature coverage layer that we have been working on for years., And I honestly think the Verizon and AT&T strategies on 5G are in some disarray at this point in time. They have reversed out of prior statements. I now hear Ultra Wideband is for capacity, not coverage. I think that is fresh from their analyst event last week. I mean your head spins, really., So that said, I mean, we are not going to respond to crazy and wacky advertising from those guys, which we think will hurt them. I mean we will start to tell our story as we have got maturity on that footprint. And it is ready to put into the hands of our customers., So a lot more to come. And sorry for the long answer. But you know me, I can’t help myself, have all the stuff I want to get out with, Jonathan., Jonathan Chaplin, And we have only got three questions on our list for you because..., Neville Ray, I promise more answers will be quicker., Jonathan Chaplin, So there is something I just wanted to pull out of what you said, which I think is really important for the audience to hear and correct me if I’m paraphrasing what you said, incorrectly. But you have intentionally not pushed the speed advantage you have over Verizon and AT&T on 2.5 gigahertz, yet. Because you don’t have it in enough markets, and you only want to advertise that aggressively once it is in enough markets where enough people are going to experience that. If I got that correct?, Neville Ray, Yes. I think I think that is fair, Jonathan, right. And I go back to what - you guys read the news read, right, and others have talked about this. I mean that Verizon Ultra Wideband footprint. You guys have counted it. We go out and measure it. It is under two million square miles today, right., So when that is way less than 1% of the U.S. population, it is a fraction of the geography in the U.S. Why would you headline advertising and break up every down football game on a Sunday to tell folks that is like 5G here, 5G is real or whatever, the BS is. When the vast, vast, vast majority of our customers can’t access it. And they are not going to access it because that footprint is not changing., So we are at 37 today. So 18 times plus. And by the end of the year, we will be 50 times that footprint, five zero. Then we believe, as we approach that, we are in a position to start really talking about an experience that the customers in many cases., And it is not going to be every case, right. You know this math better than anyone, Jonathan. 100 million pops is tremendous progress. I mean it is something to shout about. But a couple of million. I mean goodness me., I’m not sure what is going through some of the heads there. But I honestly think it is going to come back to bite those guys, and we are going to be more open, more honest and more deliberate with our messaging with our customer base and make sure that something we shout from the rooftops, many customers agreed, not all, but many customers can experience. And I think that is really important., Sorry to go on, Jonathan. But this 5G era, right, it is now upon us, right. I mean this iPhone 12 has really brought 5G access to so many customers. So 5G is kind of now happening. And you look at the last couple of years and the overpromise and over commit and this millimeter wave thing, don’t get me wrong, millimeter wave has its place., But this millimeter wave thing is going to deliver a phone in your hand, wherever you go with multi-gigabit speed. It is mythical. And I think Verizon has spent much of the last six, nine-months trying to figure out how to get out of that story, even more so now listening to them last week, and tell something that is more pragmatic. But they haven’t connected that with our advertising machine, for sure., Jonathan Chaplin, And Neville, you are hitting an important point, and you laid out, first of all, with which speed you are rolling out to 2.5. I think that is impressive. What role will millimeter wave play at all in your strategy in the near to midterm? Where would you deploy it? How aggressive would you do that?, Neville Ray, Yes. Well, I’m going to actually sound like the Verizon guys last week now. We are going to deploy it as a capacity layer where it is needed. And I will say this, I mean, the kind of the statement I use on this is millimeter wave is where you finish rolling out the 5G network. It is not where you start, right. You start with a low-band coverage layer. You add your mid-band. I call this the layer cake rate. And then where you need to, you add millimeter wave., And why? Because its propagation characteristics are incredibly limited. Despite all the work we have done in the industry has done in contrast to other spectrum sources. And so for us, I mean, we have really good - we have deployed a bunch of millimeter wave across major cities. I still believe I have one of the largest millimeter wave networks in the U.S. in Manhattan and New York, and we rolled it out some time ago., But we are still learning on the technology. The piece I’m most excited about is to use it in building and especially in stadiums and venues, we lit up the arena in Vegas recently with millimeter wave. And so we are doing more of that. And that makes sense. I know with the pandemic, it is god awful thing around the stocks aren’t in those places., But in those environments, where you are going to have 30,000, 40,000 maybe smartphones doing 5G or coming on together. I mean the stuff makes sense. But it is more from a capacity perspective than it is this 5G performance piece. Our 2.5 gig layer, as we roll that out, today has been delivering 200, 300 megabit per second speeds on average. So you can do gig peaks, right., But on average, kind of around that 300 megabits and as we can commit more spectrum to that as we go through customer migration with the Sprint base, that number gets to about 400 megabits per second, based on our engineering and what we are testing now as we close out the end of the year. So now you have something that is an order of magnitude better than the average LTE experience., And if you look globally, I mean that is kind of what is happening. That is what is happening with 5G. I mean you see this kind of mid-band rollout. We have done a lot on low band. But most countries, you look at the big Asian markets, it is kind of mid-band rollout, offering something in the hundreds of megabits per second, which is very transformative., I mean I get excited about what we have done on low band. We have doubled our speeds with low-band 5G and goodness, It took me, what, five years to double the speeds on LTE, and we have doubled the speeds with 5G layer on top of LTE with dual connectivity in almost the same number of months., And so doubling of speeds is a big deal to take those speeds up in order of magnitude, I think, is incredibly exciting. And we will faster and generate the use case, both in consumer and enterprise, with broad mobility and coverage that I think folks so excited about to sit there and promise multi-gigabit speed across a broad geography using millimeter wave, guys, it is just mythical., And I think the Verizon team, bullish as they have been on that millimeter wave story and single thread for so long, they admitted exactly that last week. He said, this is a capacity layer. It was never planned to be a coverage layer. Well, they should go back and play some of the tape from maybe a year ago or two years ago when they launched millimeter wave and what they were promising. So I think expectations have been somewhat mismanaged., And back to Jonathan’s first point in my first question. I think we have got to be really clear with consumers, what we are delivering and how we are delivering it because this noise in kerfuffle that is out there isn’t helpful at this point in time., I get why Verizon is doing it. I mean they are in a very challenged position right now as we are competing so aggressively and taking customers from them and AT&T. So they have got a fight. The way they are fighting right now is kind of a little bit of a head turner for me., Jonathan Chaplin, And Neville, to get from 40 million pops to 100 million pops on 2.5. being where you capture that order of magnitude, improvement in speed. That suggests a huge acceleration in the rollout just in the course of the next few weeks. How do you do it? And then once you have done that, are you going to be moving at a pace that would get you to 200 million pops far faster than the end of next year?, Neville Ray, Yes. So on the first piece, Jonathan, I mean the team that came out of the gate in April so fast, right. And the big, big focus - I mean we started to build some sites. But the problem we faced in April was we didn’t have the permitting backlog, right. We didn’t have the permits we needed. And you know the story. But for the audience here., I mean we can upgrade I want to be clear, and this is again a contrast to the millimeter wave story. I’m hanging radios and antennas on existing infrastructure, right. So my teams and our vendor teams, they get to a site with radio and antennas on existing steel. We are not building new towers, right. We are hanging and upgrading equipment on existing infrastructures, towers, rooftops, wherever it may be., And that work. Intense as it is, can typically be completed in 10 business days, a couple of weeks, right. Sometimes as the site complexity goes a little bit longer. But the teams, once they start construction, they are knocking out their sites super, super fast., And why I mention that is because the long pole in the tent is getting the jurisdictional approval to go do that work. And that can take anywhere from four, five months, in some parts of the country a year to get those approvals., And we have been working with the FCC, how do we speed this thing up rate on, especially on existing infrastructure. I’m not building on greenfield small cells all over gods given earth, right, in the hundreds of thousands. That takes a lot time to get done decades. I’m going on my existing sites and in some cases, some new sites that we haven’t been on before, but I’m adding infrastructure., So what does that all mean, Jonathan? So we have been aggressively driving permitting volumes over the last five, six months. And the good news is despite the pandemic, I mean it was a little nervous in the first month or two because a lot of the building departments in these jurisdictions, they shut it up., But most of them have gone to online processing. They worked through the pandemic, work effectively with us. And so now I have this huge volume of permits. But I’m eating a way into furiously with our build program., And every month now, Jonathan, we are hitting just on 2.5. We are going into construction on over 2,000 - in a month. And so that volume has been accelerating as we have gone through the year., Now I have a huge backlog of permits. And I have got a road map and a plan. I have got almost - not quite, but almost everything I need to go on air to achieve our goal for the end of the year of that into construction soon. If not, most of it is in construction right now., So our numbers are going to move pretty dramatically like week-on-week, month-on-month. Yes, it is middle of November. Every week, there is going to be a good strong update from us because we are in construction in huge volumes of sites., So it is kind of there is this hockey stick shape profile for stuff coming on air at the end of 2020. And then to your question, as we go into 2021, my whole goal this year has to been to ramp our productivity capability., And then to just to level that off and run at this pace of thousands of upgrades per month as we go through 2021. And if you math this out and I know you do, right, hence your question, it looks like we could do more in 2021., But the first 100 million is a certain number of sites. That second 100 million takes more sites, basically, right. I mean you guys know it is not equivalent, right. Pop start to thin. And then the third 100 million takes more sites again., And so what we have been doing in 2020 is building a network factory here with - and this is complex, Jonathan, right. I mean, we have got everything from all of our supply chains with our major vendors, the GCs and contractors that we use to install the equipment, our own teams, our own logistics flows., The team has done an outstanding job to get us to a rate of rollout, which quite frankly, and I have been doing this a long time. I have never seen a team executing as well on a build program. I think this is the biggest thing going on globally right now outside probably of China. I don’t think there is a level of build out and pace that is underway anywhere like this., So that is super exciting. I think it worries literal crap use the phrase stay out of my competition, and I’m delighted about that. I think that is why their strategies are in some disarray. They are watching what we are doing. I don’t think they anticipated we would be able to move so quickly., And they are incredibly concerned about what customers are going to understand 5G is all about, especially in 2021. And it is going to be about those broad availability of really high speeds, great devices are going to be out there. And folks are going to see something finally, which is differentiated., And that is going to unleash the innovation and everything, I think we are also excited about on 5G be that business, be that consumer whatever it might be, just like LTE until you have got a broad network, the innovation is not going to come. And you can’t do it on a hotspot like network with millimeter wave. Just maybe corner of a factory somewhere, yes, you can. But that is not what drives this business., Jonathan Chaplin, Neville, switching gears to the integration process. I think you said on the call, you have got 15% of the traffic of that is Sprint customers on your network, on T-Mobile network. When do you start moving the Sprint customers over, with all of the customers that have T-Mobile compatible handsets, when do they start moving over in mass and is that something you can do with the flick of the switch in the network or do you need to ship the new SIMs or is it more complicated?, Neville Ray, Yes. I mean so a lot to unpack in Jonathan, right. But I mean I just flowed up a little bit, right. So the three steps on that migration is: one, to build that capacity, right, on the anchor network, as we call it, the final network. And a big, big part of that program., I have talked about the 5G story. That is what we have talked about for most of the time here. But as I’m rolling that out, I’m building out additional LTE capacity on the anchor network because most of the customers have just LTE-capable handsets right now., So I have been doing this - I call it, the two for one thing. So every dollar that we are plowing into the network is not just delivering on 5G, it is also building the capacity we need for 5G and LTE to support migration. So that work is well underway., The secondary piece then is, now we can move the customers off of the legacy Sprint network and onto the T-Mobile network. And then that third leg of the stool, and you said it in your opening comments, is then we can start to be common drive these tremendous synergies., So we have a very different outlook on both rolling out 5G and combination of the two companies’ networks into one. So it is like perfect timing for once. I mean we litigated this deal and thought a long time to get this deal done. And it came out of the gate, so almost this perfect time with where 5G is., So we can do all these things, drive all these synergies, combine two companies together and have this leading 5G position. And that is in stark contrast to the AT&T and Verizon story. There are no synergies at the end of AT&T and Verizon’s rollout., They are doing 5G for 5G’s sake. They are scratching around and trying to figure out how they are going to make money out of it. We are going to make money at T-Mobile by taking share from AT&T and Verizon, by the way. But there is so many pieces that come together in that goodness right now for us., And so to your question on migration. I mean good volume of traffic already moved across, very pleased with that. And there is a strong volume of customers that have already moved across, Jonathan, to your point. We haven’t disclosed those accounts yet, but there are large volumes of customers we are already moving., And so what we have been doing the last six-months is building all the tools and capabilities to support that. And you are right, for the vast majority, they have a compatible handset with T-Mobile’s network. That number was well north of 80% by the time we close the transaction and continues to rise., And so what we have done is this thing we call cross provisioning. And we did this in metro, which was a very, very successful smaller agreed, smaller customer base, but very successful combination for us. And what we do is basically we make the network agnostic to the biller, if that makes sense., And so as a sprint customer, you can stay on a Sprint bill, but with the SIM change, you are now fully on the T-Mobile network, on the final network. So you get all of that goodness from the network. We can relieve the Sprint network of the capacity that you were using on the Sprint network prior, enabling movement of spectrum and ultimately decommission of sites., But you can maintain that billing relationship on the Sprint side. And why do we do it that way? Because the billing takes time to navigate. There are payment arrangements. There are all these different things. And we have seen way too many transactions, not just in Telco, I think all of us, where companies have come together, and they have tried to force, first and foremost, that billing consolidation, and it is a nightmare., So we are going to be patient with that billing consolidation. But we make sure, yes, there are an element of synergies around consolidation of the billing platforms ultimately, but it is a very small number in comparison to the network synergies., So network synergies come first, SIM changes, cross provisioning. If you go into a T-Mobile store today or a Sprint store today, and you are a new customer, you will be activated, right. So that is out of the gate. New flow is activated on the T-Mobile network., If you come in for upgrade, et cetera, et cetera, and we are reaching out to the Sprint base, you go into our stores, they are going to look to get you a SIM change in a compatible device, and onto the anchor network., So our whole retail fleet has been rebranded to T-Mobile. Wherever you go now you are going to get into that discussion. And hopefully, that movement onto the T-Mobile network. And the retail team is executing really, really well on that already., So we spent about five, six-months getting all of that built and making sure that it was a strong and seamless process for our customers, and that is now in place. And so the flow is moving. And I think when we get to maybe for 4Q earnings, maybe in the Investor Analyst event that we will hold in Q1, we will provide more detail on that., Peter Osvaldik, driving a lot of these pieces and the synergy development but that is a really strong story. And we are super excited. All of these things are happening faster from network rollout, migration and ultimately synergy development., We are trying to, and we are already accelerating all of those key pieces even though we are, what, eight, nine-months into this combination. So all of those things, execution is the key piece now, and we are making real progress., Jonathan Chaplin, Neville, it sounded like from the third quarter call that you expect to have at least the network piece done by the end of 2022. Is that correct? And can the billing piece - can the whole project be wrapped up by the end 2022?, Neville Ray, I think the whole project is tough within two years, Jonathan. The billing piece is probably almost certainly going to extend past that. On the network piece, I would love to be done by the end of 2022. But we still have a lot of wood to chop, right. So I think that is an ambitious goal for us at this point in time., 2021 is going to be a real execution year for us, where you have still got all these things in flight. You have got a lot of migrating customer flow. You have got a lot of spectrum flowing and capacity over to the anchor network. But 2021 is going to be a year where I really hope we make really strong material progress., There are certain elements we will talk about as we go into 2021 where we know what migration paths can be completed by the end of 2021. There are certain pieces and elements of the experience and technology that will be done by the end of 2021., But then the vast end state of LTE migration, end of 2022 is a great goal. But we have got to execute in 2021 to make sure we can nail that up. And it is probably too early to call that one, Jonathan, to be honest., Jonathan Chaplin, And Neville, if something goes wrong in this process, what is it likely to be - where are the sort of the toughest points and where in the process will it most likely show up?, Neville Ray, Yes. I mean I think the good news is we have built, I repeat myself here. But this last six, seven months, we have built a process and the capabilities. And now it is kind of down to execution. And that said, I mean, execution sounds like it is very deliberate, and we know exactly what to go do. And we do., And so like this network build thing, I have got to sustain a level of pace and performance there for several years. This isn’t going to get all done in 2021. We have to move through. We have FCC commitments. We have a long journey ahead of us., But we have all the pieces. We have our processes. We have our teams. We are 100% engaged on all these pieces. But there is always execution risk, Jonathan, right. And we are going into a tough period with the pandemic now. And if you would ask me back in March or April, would we be able to achieve all of the things we have achieved during 2020? I would have probably said it is going to be really, really tough., But the teams have been creative. We have worked with health and safety paramount in our heads, and we have had very few, if any, incidents. And the teams are remarkably robust and strong, and we have worked through all those pieces., But there is some risk in 4Q for everybody, right, with more shutdowns, more impacts. We are going to be battling through that. I think, again, in Q1 and Q2. And hopefully, by mid- next year, the vaccine is more prevalent. And we are starting to kick back into more normal rhythm. So there are pieces like that., Outside of that, the good news is, Jonathan, I talk about the execution, but we did this before with Metro. And we talked a lot about this playbook that we built in Metro and how we are following that playbook again as we go through this migration with Sprint., And folks have always said, well, Metro was very small in comparison to the Sprint base. And that is true because it was fully national or nationwide. But if you looked at markets like in New York or in Miami, the Metro PCS base in those markets, was actually, in some cases, greater than the Sprint base. And this is all often down to market-level detail, right., We manage capacity on a site and market level. We don’t manage it on a nationwide level, right. So that was in the detail in each of these markets, and we know well how to go and execute these plans. And the teams are seasoned in how to do this work. And manage tails on migration and all those pieces., So I mean, I’m very confident with the six, seven months of work we have under our belt, we have set ourselves up a platform for success here. I mean can I predict 2021? Who would have predicted that 2020, we had Jonathan, right., But there are a lot of external factors that can influence those pieces. But touch wood, things stay stable and strong here in the U.S. marketplace. We can go through and make sure this plan is executed well., Jonathan Chaplin, Yes. But we have got a view that you have a competitive advantage because you manufacture gigabyte to the fraction of the cost of your competitors simply because you have got a lot more spectrum than they do sitting on a similar fixed cost base. Do you see this unit cost advantage that you have in the same way, is this something that is really important to you guys, something that you will work to preserve?, Neville Ray, Yes. I mean there is a lot in that question, Jonathan. I got to be very careful about - we are in the quiet period on an auction. So I think folks understand the T-Mobile story and our fact base to-date. It is impossible for me actually, at this point in time to predict capacity stories, et cetera, going forward with the quiet period on the auction. So sorry, I can’t answer that one. I’m going to play it by my general counsel rules, 100%., Jonathan Chaplin, Right. And Neville, let me pivot to one final question before we have to close the session, which I think we could go on for another hour., Neville Ray, I’m having fun. I will keep going, if you want., Jonathan Chaplin, That is what I was hoping we do another breakout here. Well, earlier in today’s conference, we heard Tarek from Rakuten, sharing their experience with openness, cloud-native virtualization, the cost benefits and so what is your take Neville for T-Mobile, both from looking at DISH as an attacker coming in who says, well, we want to build a Rakuten style of network. And then also for T-Mobile going forward. So how do you see the application and the evolution of openness, cloud-native virtualization for your own network architecture?, Neville Ray, Yes. Let me just roll that up with kind of an - quick commentary, right. I mean, I think, be it Rakuten, what DISH is going to go do. If you are building greenfield, kind of makes sense to start building that way. But for us, I mean, I’m not building those thousands of sites a month on an ORM platform, right, at this point in time., And we are supportive and we are working better and harder to understand the ORM story, but it is not ready for prime time for us. And I think for me, there is still I have been bouncing around this industry. And I never want to sound like the guy that is not trying to drive innovation because we are. And I think we have driven material innovation, especially around 5G as T-Mobile., We bust the damn on 5G FDD, right, for the engineers and techies on the call, they understand what that means, T-Mobile did that globally. So we are often driving the big and meaningful changes in this industry. And ORM, for me, is interesting at this point in time, but there is a host of unanswered questions. And I think around IP, around R&D, around system integration., If you are assembling the kit of parts, right, today, I buy a solution from an Ericsson or a Nokia or a Samsung, it is warranted. I have one neck to choke. If something goes wrong, I know where to go. In a ORM environment, you have to do a lot more heavy lifting as the operator., And I think we saw that with Rakuten, they actually bought an SI company to help them piece the parts together, right, from a network perspective. And that is all well and good for day one, but how do you protect and drive R&D across that ecosystem? Who is ultimately responsible for all of the SI and integration? And whose neck do you choke when things go wrong? Your own, right., So there is a lot to work through. Where else for open standards and the open interfaces and all those pieces. But the model of the commercial model behind ORM. And I think everybody’s flagged these capital savings. I think that is a big TBD, to be perfectly frank. Because once folks get their head and arms around the integration costs of the various vendors, who carries all that cost, who protects all of that as you go forward. And make sure that the R&D investment is happening in alignment across what can be a series ORM competing vendors, they are big challenges., And so not to knock it too hard. I think the industry is working away on how to solve all of those, but there is a lot of wood to chop there. And for us, I know the fastest and quickest, the most meaningful way I can roll out a 5G network at real pace is what we are doing today. If I was doing greenfield, I might look at different solutions, but still been doing this a long time, and I’m not going to go and chase a bunch of capital efficiencies, which I’m not sure exists at this point., Jonathan Chaplin, Neville, thank you so much for doing this. We really appreciate, your insights are much appreciated as always., Neville Ray, Thank you, Jonathan. Yes, really I appreciate the time today.

23695,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4389710-american-tower-corporation-reit-amt-management-presents-bcg-and-new-street-research-5g,Ed Knapp - CTO,"Spencer Kurn - New Street Research, Spencer Kurn, Good morning. I am Spencer Kurn. And I cover U.S. Communications Infrastructure at New Street Research. I'm joined here by Ed Knapp the Chief Technology Officer of American Tower., Many of you may remember Ed from our conference last year but as a CTO of AMT. Ed's responsible for positioning American Tower for growth as infrastructure needs for wireless communications continuously evolve. Before we get started, I just want to mention if anybody in the audience would like to ask a question you can type it into the top in the box at the top left of your screen., So Ed at our conference a year ago, we talked about your expectations for how infrastructure will evolve to support 5G. I think a good place to start this year would be an update on your view of how 5G will drive network transformation and really be interesting to focusing on how your perspective has changed over the past year?, Ed Knapp, Yes. Thanks Spencer. It's great to be here at New Street. I wish we were physical in New York City but this will do for now at least for the last eight months as we deal with the current situation. So regarding infrastructure it's actually a pretty exciting time relative to this transformation of 5G and some of the macro trends as you would imagine are really around things like cloud native networking and being able to transform the network to a software driven model. We also see a lot of convergence opportunities if you think about wireline and wireless networks coming together as the networks become more seamless in terms of disaggregating hardware and software and turning them into more of an automated environment., The other parts we're looking at are really across the radio network and how that's transforming with ORAN. We're looking at ways in which the transport networks have to be modified to support the types of data rates, whether you're looking at front-haul, mid-haul, and even back-haul type deployments. Those are really transforming ultimately where we go with the edge of the network and it's really about this first mile because a lot of the 5G is taking data that's normally been sort of southbound from the cloud to the user and we're starting to see lot more endpoint generated with respect to IoT and some of the other newer applications that are coming., So, transport is changing. Obviously, the access networks in terms of fiber and also the radio and then edge compute are really key infrastructure trends that are really, 5G is going to help drive. And we believe as a neutral host supplier of infrastructure to create those efficiencies, we're at the center of that and we've been doing a lot of work in our innovation program to look at those business models and try to extend our core platform of macro towers., Spencer Kurn, Right. And so to dive into some of what you just touched on, a lot of the network transformation, it sounds like it's taking place not necessarily on top of the tower where AMT has really excelled over the past couple of decades. But as part of your innovation program what are the main opportunities that you're exploring for sort of broadening AMT's core area of expertise., Ed Knapp, Yes. So what we're looking at is really four elements to our program and really we look at it as extending our core tower business which is still 97% of our revenue today and when we look at it there's four areas, the power and the ability to look at sustainability, renewables and shared power. So just powering the sites is something that we're doing some really, I would say advanced work in our teams in Africa where we're doing a lot of data analytics. We're moving away from unreliable grid and into sustainable models of lithium-ion storage and solar., So we think even that trend could move to other parts of the world depending on the models for how we interact with our operators. So that's a great opportunity for transformation and growth. The other part of it is in the transport side, we look at transport in two ways. We look at it as connecting, let's say towers or small cells or even edge data centers. So that's kind of just point to point type networking, but there's also other businesses that we have in Latin America and those are looking at open network architectures for fiber to the home or fiber to the neighborhood., So those things are really also changing the landscape of how one can put in infrastructure that's open neutral host and create new value and new business models and then further more that will be used to support small cells and fiber to the tower expansions as we've done in those markets today., The other part of it is edge compute, so when you look at, ultimately the network will have to transform from what is essentially a packet core that's centralized at a region and to get low latency applications we need to start to migrate processing and applications closer to the edge and our towers are best positioned to support that as aggregation points naturally for edge processing and also on-prem if you look at venues and other types of in-building systems, those are also opportunities for low latency application processing., So, transport through the fiber networks, compute through edge processing, power is also the other key element and the fourth one is just wireless connectivity as we look at neutral host and shared networks, some of which are really based on CBRS in the U.S., Location Spectrum in Germany and how those inside networks become more of a NaaS, network as a service opportunity. And that also extends into other markets like in ITS band for CBX and automotive which also ties back into edge compute. But it all really stems from we can offer a more efficient infrastructure model to our tenants or customers because of the efficiencies of sharing as opposed to doing things and self-performing vertical., Spencer Kurn, And so you mentioned, I think the towers account for about 97% of your revenue today. As you look across these four innovation opportunities that you just highlighted, collectively how big do you think that could be over the next 5 to 10 years? And from where you set today which of those opportunities seems like it could contribute the greatest amount of revenue?, Ed Knapp, So all of them, today we're seeing -- obviously AFFO growth and margin benefits from investing in power and being able to see that capital investment perform reasonably well today. Now we would like to transform that model and extend it to other markets, but we're still early days in being able to look at how do you do that in a reliable grid environment. But that could be significant and it also could grow into, you think about Tesla Powerwall in home, imagine just our distributed real estate could also perform in some point in the future distributed storage for energy especially as you move to renewables let's say the source of wind and solar are unreliable. And as utilities move in that direction they're also going to need to look at massive storage and distributed storage and so that's an opportunity we're looking at doing some research with MIT on., The tam for that could be significant, but you can't put a number on it today because there's a lot of regulatory and other transformations that have to occur, but I think it's an important thing to keep an eye on from distributed real estate perspective., Another area in terms of transport is, if you look at fiber to the home and how those networks are converging, wireless operators want to do broadband sales potentially as a quad play. So they may have just spectrum but not infrastructure and other types of telcos would like to be working as MDNOs in a 5G slice network on top of wireless spectrum. So that convergence leads to an opportunity of saying, can you take existing let's say vertically-owned fiber networks and open them up to multi-tenant and virtual network operations., So, that would be based on a home's past model. So we have some deployments in South Africa and in Latin America where we're working with partners to be able to share that same network infrastructure and it can also support small cells and towers. So that's an opportunity, that's a fairly significant TAM because you're looking at homes passed and homes connected and being able to get a wholesale component of that with a shared infrastructure., The other part of it we're looking at obviously is edge data. There is a lot of numbers on edge data. It depends on how you partition it. But those numbers could, they're all sort of billion dollar plus opportunities in TAM and in some cases more significant depending on how many regions in the world where we operate we can take advantage of it. But in the U.S. you're looking at single digit billions at least for the edge part and then you're not looking at all of the staff. You're just looking at basically the infrastructure and the ability to support space and power and networking to a lot of sites that need to be distributed throughout the market., Relative to in-building systems, we had DAS and we have DAS today. But I think the market is expanding as operatives would look for ways to enter other buildings and properties that normally would have been tried to cover from the outside but as we move up in frequency and 5G we can start to penetrate those buildings from inside and be able to share those networks because they're naturally want to be neutral host shared networks. You don't want to have two or three networks in the same property., So we see a lot of opportunity in commercial real estate in different types of verticals, hospitality and so forth where DAS systems were maybe historically made too expensive and that becomes an opportunity for in-building systems and that TAM can be significant as well. And lot of people are looking at that today in the U.S. with CBRS and in Germany with Location Inspection., Spencer Kurn, And just to follow up on a couple of things you mentioned. So what was somewhat new to me was that you're building or you're exploring the opportunity for neutral hosts hybrid of the home models in some markets. Is that something that you see an opportunity to do in the U.S. or in other developed markets?, Ed Knapp, I think it depends. Each market is different in how the industry has evolved. A lot of it comes down to you know is there a over build, there's dominant players in the U.S. where cable really has the largest foothold and most of the telcos have tried to and have invested themselves. So unless that that market changes it may not be attractive but in other markets where folks are more open to sharing it does become an opportunity for we're looking at really two things ROIC, can we get the ROICs that are extending from our tower environment to other adjacencies and as AFFO growth's going to be part of that because you're looking at things like maintenance CapEx and a lot of other SG&A requirements., So we see opportunities there. It's early days. This is just exploratory, in some sense relative to our core business, but as part of our program of looking for ways to innovate and potentially deploy capital in the future, these are all aspects of what we wake up every day and think about at least from my part of the business which is innovation., Spencer Kurn, Got it. And then another just to follow up on another one of your comments, I think you said the TAM for edge data centers in the U.S. was about somewhere in the single digits billions range. Could you just unpack what you're including in that TAM? Is that sort of as a tower company becoming a potential landlord for edge co-location facilities or is that what you see as the overall tam for you to fully own and operate edge data centers at your towers?, Ed Knapp, So the way we look at it is, there's like four buckets of the edge. There is the device itself you can call that an automotive platform or maybe even a drone. There is inside a venue which is something we can support today with local breakout and then you get into the tower edge and then the metro edge., So what we're looking at that number we're looking at the tower edge and the metro edge. Tower being an aggregation point of some scale so not just a single tower but in the limit you could think of every tower having essentially some local processing to pull out data like for example on a rural highway where you're doing truck platooning or automotive applications and you want a mobile edge compute for lower latency processing you can envision almost every site having some form of compute based on again the transport architecture and whether or not it's appropriate to support bits back to some other location because then you start building horizontal networks as opposed to just North South networks., But I would say on the order of hundreds or thousands of locations to really take the cloud to the edge and to work and cut out in connection with the mobile operators to support that that, there will be those opportunities for let's say 100 kilowatt to 250 kilowatt centers at tower sites or in clusters and then ultimately when you look at the metro edge today it's really where things are happening, so if you look at some of the early deployments in 5G on the edge, they're really at regional or metro level. So you're talking about millisecond levels that are 20 maybe plus, 30 milliseconds not that different than what you could see today in 4G if you were really at those positions., Now the 5G airlink improves that, but at the end of the day to get down to that sub 10 or 5 or even single digit milliseconds for the future applications in AR, VR, haptics maybe other types of super low latency for automotive those types of requirements push you out to the tower edge., So that the several billion dollars of TAM is split between the tower edge and the metro edge depending on application. And when we get 5G networks fully ubiquitous and built out in mid band and you have the ability to have super low latency on the airlink, then those applications will drive closer and closer to the edge and there will be ubiquitous, you know performance capabilities, otherwise you end up with kind of erratic or let's say distribution of latencies and we really want to have tightly bound, in control, they need to just have uniform performance and user experience and the operators are all working towards transforming their architectures to support that. So the TAM consists of those two components the tower edge and it's really infrastructure at that point. I'm not talking about server hardware. I'm not talking about software stacks or SAS applications that could really explode the numbers a lot more in terms of where cloud is today and where the growth is in CAGR is going to be more towards these edge applications., Spencer Kurn, Right. I mean just to -- just to dive in a little bit deeper on the edge and how you're attacking the opportunity. You acquired Colo ATL last year and as you sort of just update us on your learnings from of the opportunity from that acquisition. What are you considering as like what does the economic and operational model look like for you, specifically does it make sense for you to be a landlord to add data center providers or is it feasible for you to move up the stack and operate the data centers yourself?, Ed Knapp, Yes. So we have a couple of experiments and some ongoing operational businesses. So we purchased the Colo ATL facility in Atlanta late last, early last year and that facility's done phenomenally well. It's more of a telco meet me room, so it's like part of that IX foundation that all data centers build around and within that facility we have space and power to support various compute applications. So from CDNS being present there to potentially we're looking at CRAN hubs and ORAN locations that can be supported out of that facility., So economically it's been really attractive. It meets a lot of our criteria financially and we're in a position where we're saying does that business at the metro level extend or are we really tying it to our towers. So we've been doing some experiments as you know we've announced six facilities that we deployed in different cities. So one is in Atlanta so we can tether it to the Colo ATL facility. One in Austin. One in Denver. One in Boulder and one in Pittsburgh and those facilities are and one in Jacksonville so those are the six Jacksonville was our first one and we've learned in each one of those steps what it takes to perform the requirements to support what would be essentially distributed compute as tam talks about., So these are distributed workloads that people would be happy to have locally near or around their franchise or facilities that they operate and those can be orchestrated from a partnership with let's call it classic Colo data center partners so that as those sales teams look for ways to extend their footprint we are already and willing partner to host that., And this would be a way to support the deployment of those sites in advance of the 5G demand when again we just talked about low latency and that wave of let's say 5G maturing where the development environment software and applications will start to embrace lower latency applications., So we're in that early stage now of exploring what markets, what locations but our value chain performance is really simple. We have a good operating point with our distributed real estate and towers. So we have a good great cost position. We also have zoning and permitting that's already set up so we can move really quickly in deploying computer, so we have a really fast time to market, low cost point and we can offer networking and space and power because we already have power at the site and there's already fiber providers., So all those things add up to be and essentially if you need smaller bite-sized chunks of computer we're in a great position to offer that and it's very synergistic with our tower business because we already have all those sites. We have a lot of sites here we've been looking and studying at for how we filter them for attractiveness. So that's what we've been doing in edge compute and there's more to come. So we believe the opportunity for us to participate in that market is real and can be significant., Spencer Kurn, It seems like edge compute has been talked about for decades, maybe a decade. Edge data centers at the towers but it really feels and it was always something that made sense but never really manifested over the past year it feels like it got real and based on your experience in watching technology unfolds, how do you think like at what point do you think we'll really be at a time when edge facilities really ramp up and sort of towards that tam that you've laid out already of a few billion dollars., Ed Knapp, So I think part of the problem was there was, there's always this pendulum of centralized and distributed in compute it's gone off whether it's mainframes to PCs to cloud. So we've gone through those but now we're at the point where there's a lot of concentration in hyperscale hybrid cloud became something really important the last few years. We're seeing all the major players whether it's Azure Stack or Outpost those are all things that are trends that say how do I bring that, let's call it multi-tenant efficient compute closer to the edge., So that trend is happening that's the distributed compute but the more important let's call it sort of catalyst will be the actual telco networks converting to cloud. So as you cloudify the network and the network sits at all of these sites that's when you're already starting to position servers and compute., So if you have distributed compute opportunities those are kind of based on customer demand and the market evolving in hybrid ways like bare metal players and others that want to be closer to the edge or CDNs that's been happening but the real transformation will be when you move to a 5G network and have local breakout. A lot of the early adopters in the last few years ran out early and said we're going to put compute at towers and we're going to do low latency., Well, guess what they didn't understand that the back-haul network doesn't break out the traffic locally at a tower yet. That architecture took encrypted let's call it tunnels from the mobile device all the way back to the core network before you hit the packet gateway to get to the internet., So there wasn't a place to tap that and so now when we moved to where we went to a cups architecture and released 14 or 4G and now in the let's call it 5G architecture you can put your exit point anywhere. So you could build what I would say local train stations to let traffic off as opposed to have the express train and because of that shift and we moved to 5G that really opens up the opportunity to really see an explosion in the edge compute and the applications that will drive that., So we're on the cusp for that. We're still a few years away from that 5G explosion but the early days have been sort of slower because people thought it was available and it wasn't. So if you came from outside the industry from IT or compute you didn't understand the wireless space now they realize what it takes to get the wireless space ready and in the interim there's a lot of these hybrid and distributed compute models that are taking shape setting the table and then we'll be ready for that explosion when 5G low latency applications actually occur., Spencer Kurn, Got it. That's fascinating and really helps frame how 5G is going to impact all different areas of the ecosystem. I'd be remiss if we didn't talk about towers for a little while. So most people know American Tower is well known for having the largest portfolio of towers in the U.S. and globally. When carriers deployed 4G there was a surge in amendment activity and then that was followed by an increase in co-location and densification after that., What are your expectations for how 5G will drive densification and amendment activities across your towers. So I think when we see the capital spend jump in every G I think we'll see the same trends as we saw in 4G. The one difference in 5G was we had a little bit of an elongated start and we had a little bit of maybe some confusion around the bands and what's appropriate because of millimeter wave and how that requires sort of really small cells at a city level but I think the main event of 5G and when that happens as we start to move through the PAL auction here the C-band option that's coming up the Sprint T-mobile merger that's really opened up 2.5 that wave of investment which will drive the wide area true 5G in some sense because we really have this layer cake as I think many folks have talked about, you have the low band which is DSS transforming., So you have to do modifications and changes to support the software updates to the 5G radios if they aren't already in place and the second wave was essentially mid band where you're going to have 3.5 like the different frequencies associated with what they call CBRS which is N48 and then N77 those bands will cover from 3.4 to say 4 gigahertz that is the main event in 5G globally and in the U.S. we're just starting to head down that path., Then in millimeter wave you have the high band opportunities some of which will find their way to towers as well for back-haul for interconnection purposes maybe for some fixed wireless applications as well but we're early days in that but the real tower transformation would occur with low band which has traditionally been what we've hosted and as new spectrum comes to market in mid band that'll be where you see a lot of the change in growth in terms of modification and co-location will occur. We're just at the beginning of that second wave., Spencer Kurn, Interestingly you didn't mention dishes new network builds that they're embarking on now. I'm sure it was just an oversight but in the wake of the announcement yesterday from Crown Castle and dish that they've signed a mass release agreement for up to 20,000 sites and with access to Crowns Fiber. How are you, how is AMT positioned to benefit from dishes new network builds not only on the tower side but potentially with all the elements of their 5G architecture that they're bringing to the table? , Ed Knapp, I think it's great and it's good to see that dish is out building and deploying. I think that's an important piece and for us at American Tower I think as you know the tower business in the U.S. is three large players at least the independent side. There is a lot of other smaller players and all of us will if dish is going to build their 15,000 sites as they talk about by 2022 and 2023 with their population, distribute across any number of partners and we expect to be participating in that as well., I think ultimately it's great to see a [forex] operator coming in and it'll drive the growth for the business. So I think the announcement yesterday was important as a first step and I think all of the participants will benefit from having another let's say spectrum provider and operator in the marketplace., Spencer Kurn, Got it. And as we think about 5G and activity over the next couple of years, the new T-mobile network integration is a big driver of growth for the industry. One of the most defining aspects of the mass release agreement that American Tower just signed recently signed with T-mobile was that, it was a 15-year contract which is much longer than a lot of your prior MLAs which have only been 10 years. But what is the significance of that? What does that mean for the amount of work that U.S. carriers need to do on towers as they deploy 5G?, Ed Knapp, Well, I think it's a big statement on the longevity of the tower business. It's a statement on the importance of macro towers to that fundamental architecture of wireless and I think it's great for both parties to think about having a long-term relationship and how we can work together. If you look at it when you think about the end of that it'll be 2035 and we'll be in 6G, so at the end of the day we're just in the beginning of the 5G deployment and every one of these deployments is at least a 10-year investment and then there's another 10 years of sort of modification and optimization as the next G occurs and so we'll be partners into a 6G world and I think it says a lot about the longevity of wireless, let's say the belief that they have in their business and the ability to be successful in the future as one of the major players in the market here in the U.S., So the technology itself and the way we work together it will allow them to get to sites quickly. We'll be able to help them in their 2.5 deployment, move quicker. Obviously this transformation of the Sprint sites is part of that and so we've the partnership really says we're locked in locking arms to be able to help them be a successful operator here in the US., Spencer Kurn, Got it. We've got a couple questions from the audience that I'd like to ask for you. So the first one is how is American Tower participating in ORAN? Is it thinking of providing remote radioheads and other components or developing a platform for deployments? , Ed Knapp, Yes. So we are active in that. I have not joined the ORAN alliance. We did, we joined the ORAN policy alliance in D.C. but not the technical piece at this point because the specifications are really a lot of the vendors and some of the operators are more active in that. What I would say is we're working with all of those ORAN let's say stakeholders on the infrastructure side talking with them and we're doing some experiments., A lot of what we see is ORAN being able to be used in neutral host models really in building and we have some experiments we're looking at in our operations in Europe to deploy an ORAN platform with 5G, the classic RU DUCU in a microservices model and we're talking to literally all the stakeholders in that space from a software and hardware and even orchestration standpoint and we haven't announced anything yet but we've done some work in this facility with Wi-Fi VI., So part of what we're trying to do is build a solution that is future proof. So for our partners and folks that would want to let's say wholesale a slice over this network think of it as a campus or a venue or an in-building network. We would be able to offer a convergence between, barriers between the Wi-Fi if it's a maybe a best efforts or some other service that needs that performance so Wi-Fi VI and 5G which might require a very precise like factory environment for low latency and high quality packet error rates., So what we're doing is we're putting those pieces together into a common system and then there is an orchestration layer that'll help manage the quality experience across that and that's sort of part of an R&D exercise to look into that with partners but it's relatively it's non-commercial, it's really kind of a sandbox. So that's one area where we're working with it and there are other projects and discussions underway with partners to talk about how we can use our facilities here in the U.S. to host that as well as internationally in Latin America., Spencer Kurn, Thanks Ed. And one other question from the audience with the changes in packing antennas as they get smaller and integrate more and more spectrum bands into them is there a risk in the future that MNOs will need smaller space on towers and that could lower revenues in the future?, Ed Knapp, So there has always been a trend to pack more bands into a single antenna. A lot of it's really trying to take different antenna elements and manage them. There is all kinds of technical requirements on PIM and interference and sort of inner mod that comes up that creates challenges to do that but we are getting better at basically as an industry both on the hardware component side and on the antenna side to pack more bands but the reality is you're still going to need low like a lower low like say 600 to 900 you're going to need, no one has anything that sort of is single from let's say lowest frequency we use in style today even down at 450 up to what's now a higher sub six of 4 gigahertz., So you're always going to have to break it up into different subcategories. Every one of them is going to have an antenna subsystem. You may be able to combine let's say a 1900 with a 900 or 600 but the fact is you need a separate radio to support that and when you move to mid band which is where a new spectrum is going to open up you need these massive MIMO antennas and those are going to create a whole new set of rad centers., So as much as there is consolidation it's really because the tower themselves have certain amount of capacity and wind loading and weight requirements and to be able to support that consolidation actually helps expansion into new bands. So I don't really see any fall off in the demand for space on the towers. I think if anything it's really trying to be more efficient with the space that we have., Question-and-Answer Session"

Start with the big agreement that you entered into with DISH yesterday, whereby DISH deploy equipment on up to 20,000 of your towers and will receive certain fiber transport services from you. This is the first infrastructure partnership that DISH has announced. So, it seems like a big deal. What’s the significance of this agreement for Crown? And the big question I’d be getting over the last 24 hours is, do you think with this agreement you’ll capture an outsized share of DISH’s deployment on towers relative to your current market share in the U.S. tower industry?, Dan Schlanger, Yes. Hey, Spencer. Thanks for having us. I appreciate the invitation and the opportunity to be here., It is a big deal that we signed with DISH, and we’re really excited about it. As you said, it’s their first infrastructure partner that they’ve announced. And it goes to a 20,000 tower site mass. And as they’ve talked about 15,000 being their first round of deployment -- 15,000 sites into the first round of deployment, obviously 20,000 [Technical Difficulty]. We can’t get too much into the details of what we agreed to with DISH. And ultimately, we need to let them talk about how they’re going to deploy their network. But, we think that we’ve set ourselves up really well to get a significant portion of how they’re going to deploy, and that we’ve put ourselves in a position of being a partner that extends just beyond -- beyond just towers, as you mentioned in your lead into the question, is that it includes fiber transport as well. And we think that was a big deal for them and trying to choose a partner is that it’s not just where do you have the right tower when you’re building a new network, they have a little bit of choice there, it’s what’s the solution that somebody can help get you to. And we believe that having a large-scale tower operations focused in the top 100 markets in the U.S. with fiber was a differentiating factor for us and something that really skewed to our direction. That’s why we’re so excited about it., Question-and-Answer Session"

Good morning and welcome to the ODC. And next up, we have a session with Seagate. And so just to let everyone know that doesn’t know me, this is Mark Newman. In Bernstein, I cover global memory as well as global in-storage and delighted to be welcoming our next guest, Dave Mosley. He is the CEO of Seagate. And we are going to start off with some brief introductory remarks from Dave and then we are going to go to Q&A. A reminder that there is – we are going through the usual protocol, so we have got the pigeonholing. I will be monitoring. And you can enter a question in there, you can also vote on questions and I will be using that to monitor the questions and try to ask any questions you put in., And with that, Dave, over to you for a few introductory remarks on yourself and Seagate, how is Seagate doing and how is the year shaping up, the fiscal year shaping up so far?, Dave Mosley, Thanks Mark. It’s great to be here virtually with everyone. Wish we could catch up in different times, of course. As a reminder, I will be making some forward-looking statements and you can learn more about these statements in our SEC filings, which are on our website at www.seagate.com., But to your point, let me just frame this to highlight a few key aspects of the business with the times that we are in right now. I think everyone knows Seagate. We are a mass capacity solution vendor, legacy of innovation that goes back 40 some years now making disk drives for all kinds of different applications. Though the last few years has really dealt with this kind of unabated growth in mass capacity storage, that’s for the big secular trend towards hyperscale and even edge scale out, which is kind of incredible and it’s now about two-thirds of our revenue and three-fourths of our exabyte shipments are actually pointed there. So, no longer is it laptops and mission-critical drives now, it’s more of this mass capacity stuff. So we pivoted over the last few years. We have done that with a strong technology roadmap, which we have been very thoughtful about and how do we stage the right component tree, whether it’s the recording heads or recording media or disk drives for that. All of our high-capacity HDDs now are based on a common platform approach that well, that allowed us to get to 16 terabytes early and it will get us to 18. and even 20 terabytes, I think provides us the ability to produce not only those drives, but also the midrange capacity points as well, 12, some 14s and things like that and we can do that so we get better synergies inside of our manufacturing operations, better cost synergies, cost efficiencies and we can go after the market a little bit more aggressively that way., This quarter also, we are going to introduce a new technology, which is called HAMR. We have been talking about for a long, long time. It’s a critical milestone really for the industry, because this HAMR, heat-assisted magnetic recording technology, doesn’t just – it’s not a simple extension of our old S-curve, it’s actually a new S-curve itself and really allows capacity jumps of 10 terabytes or even more, so we should get to 30 and 40 and 50 terabytes some day, which is what the world needs to run data centers more and more efficiently. It also keeps the differentiation within the other technology solutions that are out there, and we can talk about that if you want to. This need to store more data is not only evident in the hyperscale, there’s also a lot of stuff happening on the edge right now, and we believe there’s a lot of edge applications for mass capacity storage, starting to break it down a little bit into micro edge and metro edge. And there is some natural use cases that are coming out, but it’s really about decentralized data. Again, not everything is going to be centralized in one cloud. So we have just recently been talking about this new Lyve storage platform which is meant to get at that. All the complexity of data management in a distributed enterprise world, that’s how we’re thinking about it. And we would – I would love to take questions about that. That’s – we believe that’s a good growth vector in the future., Just to tie off to the current market environment, December quarter is off to a good start. The linearity is good. The end markets are tracking pretty well with our expectations and which is actually pretty different than the last couple of quarters that we have seen during COVID. But the COVID pandemic is by no means behind us from a supply chain perspective. There is still logistics issues that we have, so continuing to manage our business really carefully through these times and making sure we stay nimble in our supply chain. Our long-term outlook really hasn’t changed. I mean it’s all about this big growth in mass capacity storage. Data is going to explode because of IoT and AI and ML. All the things, smart cities, everything else people are talking about, all these trends are true in the public cloud, but they’re also true in the private cloud and on-prem kind of investments, and they really fuel some of these mass capacity trends that we talked about, things like Lyve and whatnot. So, all this long-term confidence in our business is illustrated by the fact that we just announced a dividend raise of 3% and a share buyback authorization at $3 billion additional. From my perspective, that’s a confidence factor in our long-term free cash flow that we can generate in this business. I am pretty excited about these times. I know they are tough for everyone, but we are reacting really well as a company. I am happy to take your questions., Question-and-Answer Session"

Wainwright & Co., Galileo Russell - HyperChange, Michael Shlisky - Colliers Securities, James McIlree - Bradley Woods & Co., Jed Dorsheimer - Canaccord Genuity, Mark Frohnmayer, Welcome to our 2020 Q3 Corporate Update Webinar. I'm going to start out by playing a slightly remixed company intro video. And then Chief Strategy Officer, Jesse Fittipaldi, and I are going to run through some -- a short slide deck., And we're doing something a little bit different this time. We brought together a panel of analysts. So the management team and analysts will engage in a discussion for the balance of the call. Eric Fritz, our Chief Marketing Officer, will be minding the Q&A through the Zoom interface. So if you have questions, those will get interjected into the mix as well., So with that, I am going to play a little video. One moment., [Video], So just to reiterate really quickly, again, the vision of Arcimoto is simply the rightsizing of the vehicle platforms that we use everyday. And by rightsizing it -- the platform to a human scale, we believe that we can deliver something to the market that is fundamentally disruptive in terms of price and sets a new bar for efficiency for daily transportation., We're going after a giant market, and we have -- our product family is built around slices of that overall vehicle market. If you've been following with us for a while, you've seen this slide before. And in what we announced this morning is that we now have a product that fits squarely into that fourth category. So the daily driving Fun Utility Vehicle, the Deliverator for last-mile delivery, Rapid Responder for those on the front lines and now the Roadster, which is our sort of halo product, pure fun machine that we're incredibly excited about and incredibly excited about the partnerships that we've developed to put it in the marketplace., We are using one platform, and it's actually Sameer who came up with this notion of multiple shots on goal for one platform that shares the very same economy of scale. And if you follow vehicle companies, you hear a lot about platforms that work across multiple different vehicles. For us, it's a little bit different. I mean approximately, 90% of the parts are shared between all of the products on the platform, and we plan to use the very same assembly line to build those products., So the three that we had talked about previously, the Fun Utility Vehicle in production now. Deliverator and Rapid Responder are in pilot. And then we teased both the Cameo, which is our lead into a flatbed utility vehicle; and then the Roadster we announced development of just this morning. So the overarching goal for the company today is to get to mass production. We have built out our team, really filled key seats in quarter 3, both in the internal team as well as industry collaborations. And probably the couple of really significant ones that have been recent are the development work that we're doing with Munro & Associates. Over the summer, we did really kind of a high-level run-through of the whole vehicle architecture and a dissection of every single part and assembly process. And what we're engaged in right now is actually our first 3 engineering projects in tandem with Munro. And that's an updated design for the front clip for mass production, a full rigorous cost-down analysis for the parts on the vehicle and then a deep simulation analysis that will lead directly into the light-weighting of the product., So the other really critical collaboration that we have done is what we announced with DHL. And it's -- I think it's hard for me to overstate the importance of that. What they figured out was how to get vehicles from our dock into the driveways of Arcimoto customers as a common carrier. And that really -- it -- that is going to simplify the process of delivering vehicles for the whole United States and ultimately provide the springboard to the world., So what has been typical of vehicle companies that sell direct is sort of a piecemeal approach based on different states' franchising laws, this gives us a common solution for all of our customers and has the added benefit of allowing us to -- for states where they are delivering from Arcimoto to a customer where we don't sell direct actually is, I think, more optimal in the sense that we can actually book the revenue when it leaves our dock instead of when it arrives at our customer., We also announced that Progressive, the leading motorcycle insurance carrier in the country, is -- now carries the Arcimoto as part of their web interface. We've teamed with Road America for roadside assistance. And what you'll see over the course of the next year, we believe, is more and more of filling up those key ecosystem pieces to be in scale production. Because it's one thing to produce 50,000 vehicles plus per year, that's a huge challenge in and of itself, but we need the support framework in the market for that to actually be viable for sales., Alongside that, we're planning to announce -- we've been selling on the West Coast primarily for -- since the inception of production, and we believe that in the coming months that we will announce new market areas where we're going to be delivering into., And then finally, where we see the primary capital source that we're targeting for the funding of the capital expenses of scaling production is the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program through the Department of Energy. And we are still pushing to get that application in by the end of this year., So what we talked about on the last quarterly call, and I'm going to go through this with Jesse on the next slide as well is that we are -- we believe we are still tracking with the goals that we set out in our Q2 earnings call. And we're real excited about it., So Jesse, you want to talk a little bit about our near term, please. And actually let me -- before you do that, there is -- we did drop another video right at the end of the market -- right after the market closed today. And I think this is really important to highlight, which is that our overarching goal is get to scale production. In the near term, we want to make sure that our early adopters are really, really happy with the products that they've got. And so we're going to -- this little piece is just a quick interview with some of the folks who have been early to get Arcimoto vehicles., Jesse Fittipaldi, Cool, Mark. That leads well into this conversation here. The mission for Q3 and Q4 for Arcimoto is -- has been to deliver a reliable products on time to happy customers. We believe that fulfilling that mission and building a foundation of a company that can do that allows us to successfully scale. So I think that video is a good visual of the happy customers in them, their feeling of our product., We have had to get the other issues before you get to scale is your supply chain. So that -- getting all that in order and our quality team, customer service, sales, all the things that people don't see that are required to deliver a reliable vehicle with really good success in Q3., Mark Frohnmayer, Awesome. Yes. And I would say, just to add on to that, the -- we have definitely faced channel bottlenecks in the process. And that is to be expected in any scale-up of an operation. And this, of course, has been compounded by the fact that we are in the midst of a raging pandemic. And that has affected us in a very, I would say, a small amount in that we have had to really rethink our production processes and our health and safety processes, but it's also been a hit to some of our suppliers., And we're expecting that those will largely be alleviated in Q1. And probably our most significant hurdle has been the manufacturer or vacuum-formed plastics. And we are in the process of vertically integrating the build of those components. And that's going to have an effect, both on our ability to move material smoothly through the process. It's going to be a substantial cost reduction for the vehicle, and that's going to come online in Q1., So the elements that we talked about in the Q2 call we're targeting 3 per day consistent by the end of quarter four. We believe we are still on track for at least 1 week of continuous 3-day production by the end of this quarter. We aim to sustain that throughout quarter 1. And then by the end of quarter 1, we believe we are still on target to get to 4 per day. So again, the targets that we outlined in Q2, we believe we are on track. And again, there will be just a heavy caveat to that in terms of the progress of the pandemic which leads into the pandemic update. So again, this is going to be near-term revenue uncertainty and full speed ahead for scale planning. So we believe that the health of our team and of our broader community is paramount. We are reliant on every single member of the Arcimoto team to help us get to this next major step of the company. We have, to date, had 0 confirmed cases of COVID-19. And we attribute that both to the general focus of this within our broader community as well as the fact that we are taking it very seriously and that our team is taking it very seriously., So we are, again, expecting that, that production and revenue impact in the near term is primarily due to supply chain, a little bit to manufacturing process improvements. And I think what's also really worth mentioning here is that most of the work we have to do today is planning and engineering for scale production. And that's actually been I think going faster as a result of the fact that we are working from home, we're able to much more easily collaborate with people who are in Detroit, who are in Southern California. We're all using the same tools and all using the same language. And we're getting -- really getting the hang of working remote and collaborating across the country. So the near-term hits, I think, are pale in disadvantage compared to the huge advantage of moving faster on getting to scale., And then finally, the Roadster, we announced that we are -- we teased this over the course of the last couple of weeks. And then we announced just this morning that it's officially a product in development. This will be Arcimoto's halo product. This is the first product that we are delivering -- planning to deliver that really goes into an existing very well understood market, which is the market for fun, go things on the road. And I would put vehicles like touring motorcycles, other gas powered 3-wheelers, sports cars. The fun machine is a well-understood category in the marketplace, and we have picked fantastic development partners for this. Corbin-Pacific is developing the whole seat and saddle piece of the vehicle. And the National Cycle, leader in motorcycle windscreens, is developing the windscreen for the Roadster., And partly because the platform is already very stable and good to go and partly because we've got great team members, we think this is actually going to go into production in the relatively near time frame. So higher margin, simpler build. And as we are running numbers. And again, this is -- I'm going to say this is a highly caveated forward-looking statement, but we believe that if things go tightly according to potential, that with the capital that we have on hand, we could build to cash flow positive because of the inclusion of the Roadster and the product family., So that is not to say -- again, to get to mass production scale, we think we are going to require substantial additional capital and we're looking to the nondilutive Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing Loan Program to get there. But we think that in a lower volume production scenario, with the facilities that we have, that the Roadster provides a fundamental shift in the calculus of our product family. So it also gives us a new audience. And as we look to scale, the Roadster is another important arrow in the quiver for building that sales picture into the 50,000-plus units per year realm., Also, I should say that our preorder customers will have the option to choose a Roadster instead of a Fun Utility Vehicle should they so desire. And I think as you see where we begin to open new markets, we think some of those new markets that we're going to open in the near term will be very optimal for the Roadster as well as the FUV. So stay tuned on the Roadster front, but it's something that we are incredibly excited about., So just to summarize, I'm going to summarize this that we have -- in quarter 3, we launched multiple high-visibility pilot programs. We launched -- deepened our collaboration with industry scale experts. We teamed with a global logistics giant for the delivery of our products. We faced incredible challenges from the pandemic to global fire storms that were -- global scale fire storms that were right at our doorstep. And in spite of that, we had a fantastic September of deliveries. Our September year-to-date revenue surpassed every prior full year. Our balance sheet is the strongest it's ever been in the company's history. We did a significant capital raise at the strongest valuation in the company's history. And yet we're maintaining fiscal discipline over every aspect of the process., So we got back in the saddle on production and delivery. Our marketing team has been knocking out a bunch of pieces from our beta Configurator to new videos that really show much more of the customer experience of the vehicle, and I think those will be very useful tools as we go to scale. So this was, to me, the most fantastic quarter in Arcimoto's history, and I think it builds -- lets us build a foundation for the future success., So with that, I am going to stop sharing these slides and open up to our analyst presentation -- so this is going to be -- this is -- we have our full C-suite here on the call, Chief Operating Officer, Terry Becker; Chief Strategy Officer, Jesse Fittipaldi; Chief Marketing Officer, Eric Fritz; Chief Financial Officer, Doug Campoli. At least one of you out there was frustrated that you were only hearing from me. So now you got the whole team., And we've got -- in terms of analysts, Sameer Joshi from HDW; Michael Shlisky from Colliers; Jed Dorsheimer from Canaccord Genuity; James McIlree from Bradley Woods; and then Galileo Russell from HyperChange. So the way we are going to do this, welcome you all. I'm just going to go through one at a time. You'll get one sort of question dialogue. And then we'll also have Eric Fritz is going to be going through the Q&A submitted by the audience and picking out questions. So who wants to go first, raise your hand., Question-and-Answer Session"

Bernstein & Co., Mark Newman, Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Mark Newman from Bernstein. And next session up, we've got David Zisner, CFO of -- sorry, David Zinsner, sorry, CFO of Micron; and also with Farhan Ahmad, who's the Head of IR for Micron Technology., So I think you all know who Micron is. We're going to have a brief introduction from Dave on how business is going. And then we'll go straight to Q&A. Reminder, this is interactive Q&A. We've got the Pigeonhole link. If you don't know where it is, you should reach out to our corporate access team. The Pigeonhole link will let you add questions. I'm monitoring that right now, and I will try to get to your questions if you put any in. And you can also vote on any questions that are already submitted., So with that, Dave, hope you're doing well. And would you like to give a brief -- kind of few opening comments on how business is going in the last few months and maybe outlook., David Zinsner, Okay. Great. Thanks, by the way, Mark, for having us. Appreciate the time. Just always want to start with the preamble here that I might make forward-looking statements. And they may have risk factors. So anybody that wants to look at those risk factors, they're filed in the most recent 10-K. Also, I might make comments around non-GAAP numbers. So there's a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP on the Investor Relations website., So thanks, everyone, for joining. I hope everybody is staying safe and healthy. Just a quick update on how the quarter is going. So we are a little bit more than 10 weeks through the quarter. We still have a little less than 3 weeks to go. And obviously, those 3 weeks tend to be pretty important weeks for Micron. That being said, I think through the first 10-plus weeks of the quarter, we feel really good about how the business is going. It's tracking really well. Markets are tracking well. We seem to be executing particularly well operationally. So very pleased with how the quarter is shaping up., I think as we talked about on the call also, we're incredibly enthusiastic about how calendar '21 is likely to shape up for us. A lot of tailwinds to the business. Mobile should be really strong, given 5G. The cloud business should -- which is healthy today, should actually see good growth next year. Graphics is doing well for the quarter. We would expect graphics to do well through the year. Automotive is already starting to see a recovery. And I think any of the markets that have seen an impact from COVID, like automotive, like consumer, should start to see recovery, in some cases, already are seeing recovery, should see recovery in '21., So we're pleased, obviously, really pleased with how healthy things are for the quarter, and incredibly enthusiastic about how next year should develop in particular since it looks like a couple of vaccines will be available. We should start to see good GDP growth next year, recovering off of this year. That should also be helpful. We have had an impact from our industrial business. That should obviously be in a much better situation next year. So yes, so again, still a couple of weeks to go. So can't claim victory just yet, but pretty satisfied with how things have gone so far., Mark Newman, Great. Well, the good news is you've just broken through $60 today. Now currently trading at $61 as I see. So it's nearly, I think, investors starting to kind of get behind it. Yes, it's been -- for the stock, it's been a fairly rough year, I think, compared to other tech stocks, right? And the reason for that has been some of the worries around demands and pricing did great for a few quarters and then has, unfortunately, weakened the second half of this calendar year. Clearly, we're all hoping for this recovery in the demand, which will lead to stabilization recovery and prices. I know that's what we are forecasting., Question-and-Answer Session"

23634,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4389469-eli-lilly-and-company-lly-presents-bernstein-2020-operational-decisions-conference-transcript,"Andrew Adams - VP, New Therapeutic Modalities, Mark Mintun - VP, Neurodegeneration and Pain, Jeff Emmick - VP, Diabetes Product Development","Ronny Gal - Bernstein Research, Ronny Gal, Hi, everybody, and thank you for joining us today. In this session of the ODC we have a special treat for you, Kevin and the Eli Lilly IR team were kind enough to let us have a conversation today with three of the scientific leaders, Andrew Adams, who runs New Therapeutic Area Modalities and also the COVID-19 section. Mark Mintun, I hope I’m not ruining your name too much, the VP of Neurodegeneration and Pain, and himself quite a notable neurodegeneration scientist. And Jeff Emmick, who is the VP of Diabetes Product Development, in charge on, I guess all the clinical sites diabetes products and a few other related areas., So, this design is that probably a bit of a too long of a conversation with each one of them for the next 45 minutes. I’ll try to kind of save 15 minutes for topics. The first discussion will be around COVID, then neurodegeneration and diabetes, will close this out., So, with that Andrew, really appreciate you being here. And I wanted to first ask you about bamlanivimab, your single agent, 700 milligram COVID antibody. It seems that this -- the data for the combination antibody is better than mono with quite a bit of margin. Do you plan to deploy the monotherapy as a long-term therapy or is this more of a hold off -- hold on until you are able to make more of the combination, and no combination is authorized? How do we think about those two products co-existing, in kind of like the six months to a year horizon?, Andrew Adams, Yes. Thanks, Ronny. I think, that’s a really important question. And there are a few things that feed into our thinking on that. One is, with the data we have today in terms of the virology, you’re absolutely right that if you look across the time for us, the combination does look better in reduction of viral load than the monotherapy. Although I think it’s important to keep in mind that when we’re looking at those figures, it is a log scale. And so, the monotherapy, I think, early on is giving you a fairly substantial reduction on day three and day seven as well. And so, the interesting thing to me though is, when you take that separation in virology, which is really interesting, and then compare that with symptomatic improvement, we actually see equivalent effects on symptoms and hospitalization at the monotherapy and the combination therapy. And so, it suggests to us that at least that things that maybe not tightly linked between absolute reduction in viral load and subsequent symptoms, and that there may be a threshold that we need to cross in terms of reduction of viral load early that than leads to the improvement in symptoms in patients to get the monotherapy or the combination therapy., I think, we’re pragmatic as well there. I think when we talked about this seven, eight months ago, we were talking about combinations of antibodies as a way to extend the longevity of the therapies, because we are, every time we treat a patient, hoping to not encounter treatment failure. Treatment failure, typically in the virology space is coming from resistant variance that develops the things like the antibodies. We see, with the combination therapy, a lot fewer of the variance, basically no variance with our cocktail therapy so far. And so, I think that over time, if that’s there in larger populations, then you could imagine that the rate of treatment failure will likely do low in combination therapy than in monotherapy. And so, you would have a longer term therapy that would last longer. I mean, treatment failure because of variations in virus, that’s standard practice in virology, right? We know this from RSV; we know this from Ebola that viruses mutate. And so, for us, I think, the key to the combination is that hopefully in the post vaccine world, when we’re all mostly vaccinated, the few people that need these therapies will have something that we can have to be effective for years. And that’s what the strategy’s behind the combination is to provide a long term therapy for those people., Question-and-Answer Session"

And thank you for joining us on today’s conference call to discuss Palo Alto Networks’ Fiscal First Quarter 2021 Financial Results. I am Karen Fung, Senior Director of Investor Relations. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed on the Investors Section of our website at investors.paloaltonetworks.com., With me on today's call are Nikesh Arora, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Luis Visoso, our Chief Financial; and Lee Klarich, our Chief Product Officer., This morning, we issued a press release announcing our results for the fiscal first quarter ended October 31, 2020. If you would like a copy of the release, you can access it online on our website., We would like to remind you that during the course of this conference call, management will make forward-looking statements, including statements regarding the impact of COVID-19 on our business, our customers, the enterprise and cybersecurity, industry and global economic conditions, our expectations related to financial guidance, operating metrics and modelling claims for fiscal second quarter and full year, expenses contribution to our fiscal 2021 ARR, our expectations regarding the timing of completing our acquisition of Expanse, our competitive position and the demand and opportunity for our products and subscriptions, benefits and timing of new products, features and subscription offerings, including those from our proposed acquisition of Expanse, as well as other financial and operating trends., These forward-looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these statements. These forward-looking statements apply as of today. You should not rely on them as representing our views in the future, and we undertake no obligation to update these statements after this call. , For a more detailed description of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on September 22, 2020, and our earnings release posted a few minutes ago on our website and filed with the SEC on Form 8-K. Also, please note that certain financial measures we use on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. For historical periods, we have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in the supplemental financial information that can be found in the Investors section of our website located at investors.paloaltonetworks.com. , And finally, once we have completed our formal remarks, we will be posting them to our Investor Relations website under the quarterly results section. We'd also like to inform you that we will be virtually participating in the Wells Fargo TMT Summit on December 1 and the Barclays Global TMT Conference on December 10. , Please also see the Investors section of our website for additional information about conferences we may be participating in. , And with that, I will turn the call over to Nikesh., Nikesh Arora, [Indiscernible] user conference which stats tomorrow morning. This is my tenth quarterly call at Palo Networks. The one thing in common between the first and the tenth is they were both 5 am calls. I finally feel that we're turning the corner on all that we've over the last few years. We have a lot of interesting stuff in store for you on this call., In addition to sharing our first quarter results, we will discuss the financial impact of our proposed acquisition of Expanse. Since Luis joined us last quarter, he and I have had the privilege and opportunity to talk to a lot of you. And based on the feedback, we've come up with a more transparent approach to understanding our business. And hopefully, it gives you a better understanding of what we have been up to and a way to think about Palo Alto Networks 2.0. , Over the last 7 months, I've been cautious on the pandemic, and our teams have continued to deliver and surprised me to the upside. I'm delighted to report this is no longer a coincidence. Our customers are investing, our teams are executing and our strategy of innovating in our firewall business and focusing on the next-generation of products around cloud and AI in the industry is working. As you can see, we had a great start to fiscal year 2021 as we exceeded guidance across all metrics in Q1. , Here are some of the highlights. We delivered strong billings of $1.08 billion, up 21% year-over-year with strong growth across the board, driven by continued strength in Next-Generation Security or NGS Billings growing at 53% year-over-year and NGS ARR of $719 million., Revenue was up 23% to $946 million, driven by strength in our cloud-based subscription and support revenue businesses. Non-GAAP EPS was [indiscernible] from last year. EPS expansion was driven by revenue growth and operating expense leverage due to efficiencies as we have seen across the industry from lower spend associated with travel and events around COVID., Adjusted free cash flow margin was 53.4%. As mentioned last quarter, we expected a strong cash quarter following the record Q4 2020 billings. We think some of this will continue into the next quarter, but we expect this to normalize for the year around our full year guidance. This continued strength during the pandemic makes me cautiously optimistic about the future prospects of the business. While we expect the winter will try all of our collective resolve with COVID, the worst-case scenarios are unlikely to unfold, and we expect our customers to continue to invest in technology. I also feel that the strategic bets we made a few years ago are right for our customers in the current environment. , Against that backdrop I feel comfortable raising guidance for the full fiscal year even before including the contribution of our proposed acquisition of Expanse, which we announced last week., Fiscal 2021 and at the midpoint guide, we expect total billings growth of 19%, up 300 basis points from our prior guidance. Total revenue growth of 20% to 21%, up 300 from our prior guide. Next generation securing ARR to be approximately $1.15 billion up 77% year-over-year., We also expect non-GAAP operating adjusted free cash flow expansion up from our prior guidance to be flat year-over-year. Subject to close this includes a benefit from Expanse of approximately 100 basis points of billings growth, 50 basis points of revenue growth and $77 million in ARR. We will absorb Expanse’s operating expenses within the framework of our guide., Let me now highlight some of the key innovation launched in Q1 and the very positive customer traction, starting with our Firewall business. We continue to drive innovation within our Firewall business. We recently extended our new enterprise DLP solution to integrate with our complete Firewall platform. Our DLP offering is a cloud-delivered service that is powerful, simple to deploy and protect sensitive data where their customer keeps the data in the cloud, on-prem or takes a flexible approach. This launch takes our number of potential attached subscriptions to eight from four, just two years ago. We also introduced an innovative joint solution with our VMCs virtual firewall and AWS Gateway Load Balancer. Our engineering level partnership with AWS enabled us to launch this new capability that significantly simplifies deployment, improves the scale and performance and reduces the total cost of ownership of our VMC customers., Going forward, we will continue to provide leading innovation to our customers. One example of this is the upcoming launch of our new 5G native security offering. Our unique approach to 5G security, we're the first to introduce 5G network slice security, 5G context-driven security, and much more, all in a containerized solution matching the preferred architecture of 5G. Not only will this allow mobile operators to secure their 5G infrastructure, but it also enabled them to launch value-added security services to their growing enterprise customers who are leveraging 5G for many new used cases., As a result of our efforts to drive innovation our firewall business continues to receive industry accolades. I'm excited to share that Palo Alto Networks has crowned again as a leader in Gartner's Magic Quadrant for Network Firewalls. This is a ninth consecutive time we are a leader in this Magic Quadrant. Once again, we achieved the highest and furthest overall position in the Magic Quadrant for our ability to execute and our completeness of vision. Not only was our strength in next generation firewall product capability to recognize, but our services like DLP and focus on cloud security was cited as trends as well., In Q1, we were also recognized as the leader in The Forrester Wave™: Zero Trust eXtended Ecosystem Platform Providers report. Noting that we have assembled a robust portfolio that delivers zero trust everywhere, on-premise in the data center and in the cloud. Our strategy in firewall is working as Firewall as a Platform grew billings by 16% in Q1 2021 and we added approximately 2000 more customers for a total of 71,000 next-generation firewall customers. Our software next-generation firewalls, VM-Series, and CN-Series continue to gain momentum as well. And we now have over 10,000 customers using our software firewalls., Moving on to our SASE or secure access service edge solution, Prisma Access and CloudGenix, as SD-WAN has become the primary WAN architecture, organizations are demanding solutions with a better user experience while being simpler to deploy and manage. In the quarter, we introduced a number of new additions to our next generation SD-WAN solution, CloudGenix. This included new AML-base capabilities to enhance our AI Ops approach and further simplified network operations. , Two new SD WAN appliances, a small form factor appliance designed for retail and small offices and home offices and high performance applications suited appliance suited for large campus and data center locations. We also delivered the first CloudGenix and Prisma Access integration which seamlessly enables cloud delivered brand security in just a few clicks. In addition to the Gartner Magic Quadrants network firewalls, Palo Alto Networks’ CloudGenix SD-WAN was recognized as a leader in the 2020 Gartner Magic Quadrant for WAN Edge Infrastructure., For many of our customers, COVID accelerated the digital transformation timelines, and we continue to see conversion and remote access trials and very strong pipeline generation. We now have more than 1000 Prisma SASE customers, more than double from a year ago., To highlight a deal from the quarter, we won a seven-figure SD-WAN deal with a U.S. retailer who had already been a Palo Alto Networks customer for a number of years was an early adopter of Prisma Access. The success that we had with Prisma Access and the strong integration with CloudGenix was a winning combination. And this customer is now a full SASE customer., Switching to Prisma Cloud. Prisma Cloud is very well positioned for sustainable growth as it is at the heart of the global shift to cloud computing. In Q1 2021, we launched Prisma Cloud 2.0 introducing four new modules to enable customers to easily and rapidly extend their cloud security coverage in a number of critical areas, all within a single cloud native security platform. These modules are data security, which discovers and protects cloud storage data at a scale and velocity common in public cloud environments and addressing one of the most common data exposure issues in cloud transformation, includes web application and API security, which protects web applications from attacks., Our approach addresses the challenges of deployment, complexity and scalability by leveraging the same agent as our container and host security, making it very easy and horizontally scalable. We launched identity-based micro-segmentation with the integration of Aporeto technology, enabling zero trust security for cloud applications in a cloud native identity based approach., And lastly, IAM Security, which allows security teams to gain visibility into effective cloud identity permissions, user activity, implement governance and respond to issues. While only recently introduced we are excited about the strong customer interest we’re seeing. Prisma cloud now serves 20% of the Global 2000 companies, 70% of the Fortune 100 companies and secures 1.8 billion cloud resources. This customer momentum is up from the 14% of Global 2000 companies reported last quarter and up significantly from the 43% of Fortune 100, that we reported two quarters ago. We're also seeing substantial increase in Prisma Cloud customers are using both cloud security posture management and cloud workload protection for containers and serverless applications now at 45%, up from a third we reported last quarter., To highlight the benefits of our consumption model, we won a high seven-figure deal with a leading technology company to use Prisma Cloud for CSBM for AWS and cloud workload protection. This customer has quickly consumed the workloads purchased and we are working with them to support the expansion to new clouds and new workloads., Moving to Cortex. Cortex is on its way to being the industry's first proactive security platform, collecting data across the multiple security data sources, applying machine learning techniques to detect sophisticated threats before they have a chance to succeed and fully automating response for known threats. We've seen some incredible benefits to customers who adopted Cortex from customers seeing up to 50x reduction in alerts to customers automating more than one million incidents per day. And based on a telemetry, we can see that we have recently passed the marker 400 million actions automated up 100% in just four months. As a result, we're winning with customers who share our vision, including 34% of the Global 2000 and 65% of Fortune 100., We continue to drive product innovation in Cortex XDR. Our recent XDR 2.5 release, includes many new capabilities that have enabled us to catch up in a number of various or passing leading EDR products. For example, we introduced host insights. Our first add-on module for XDR, which provides vulnerability assessment, application visibility, and our new search and destroy feature. And to our knowledge, we are the first EDR product to offer the search and destroy capability that will greatly speed up security response and eliminate the need for additional endpoint agents., This might be a good time to highlight a customer when we had recently. We won a seven-figure deal, and this is a story we hear every day. The customer has a small SecOps team managing multiple point products that were generating too many alerts with too few resources to investigate every alert, leaving them exposed to advanced threats, being able to quickly investigate alerts and identify and remediate threats was a critical requirement. That existing EDR product was disjointed from the rest of the security infrastructure, making it difficult and time consuming to correlate data., At the same time, there's seamless consuming a large chunk of the annual budget with little ROI. We challenged their way of thinking by demonstrating how the Cortex platform could automate and streamline security operations allow them to consolidate multiple products, including the SIM into Cortex. We demonstrated how Cortex will help transform the SecOps team by automating routine processes and knocking down alert volume by more than 95%, allowing them to focus on the critical field., In Q1, we also launched the XSOAR Marketplace, which opened up the platform to both our partners and customers. And we now have over 500 content bags available to customers to enable automation for the security solutions. Additionally, we are seeing engagement and momentum within our partner ecosystem with contributions and used cases ranging from insider threat to cloud security and threat intel management., The last deal I want to share with you is a Fortune 500, diversified financial services company. Prior to implementing Cortex XSOAR, this customer was receiving over one billion threat alerts per week. Completely overwhelming their security operations team, leading to a state where alerts were disregarded creating a significant security gap. , By leveraging XSOAR and XSOAR threat intel management, they were able to take full control of threat information by aggregating disparate information sources, automatically customizing and scoring fees and matching indicators against that environment as well as leveraging playbook automation drive interaction. This combination of automation tactics reduced the number of threat alerts they received by more than 99%, creating a significantly more secure rand., Moving quickly to Expanse. Last week, we announced our intent to acquire Expanse and told you about what they do and how they fit within our overall vision of Cortex. Expanse has dedicated themselves to developing an internet collection and attribution platform that constantly monitors the global internet. Mapping the exposed and untracked assets of an enterprise that comprised its attack surface. This data gives organizations a crucial picture from the outside end. That is to say the same view that an attacker sees when hunting for potential weaknesses. It’s because of insight that their technology is trusted by some of the world's largest and most complex organizations from members of the Fortune 500 to the U.S. military., With our user conference Ignite kicking off in a little over 24 hours, we're excited to share that outside in view with our customers. We work with Expanse to offer all CIOs and CISOs attending in EXPANSE Exec Report, which provides a vulnerability map and immediate insights to customers complete attack surface, risks and suspicious activity., This is a great lead generation tool for us, sales teams to hit the ground running once we closed on the transaction. Expanse’s transaction multiples are very favorable compared to other companies of equivalent size and even more so when adjusting for growth. , Now to the financials. As we said in our call last week, on a standalone basis, we expect Expanse to contribute $67 million of ARR to our current fiscal year ending July 2021, continuing its 100% growth momentum. With Palo Alto Networks and subject to close, we expect Expanse to contribute $73 million of ARR in FY 2021. Assuming a mid to late Q2 close, we expect Expanse billings to contribute about 100 basis points of our growth to our overall billings for FY 2021, and adjusting for purchase accounting, we expect Expanse revenue to contribute about 50 basis points for overall revenue for FY 2021., I know that you get concerned about M&A strategy, perhaps because inorganic impact or P&L is hard to forecast new models. But if you look at the $2.7 billion of acquisitions we have done since 2019, they contribute approximately 15% for forecasted FY 2021 billings. A very large enterprise companies have been built by successful M&A strategies. Good M&A strategies need to ensure the products are easy to integrate their products customers want, and that we at Palo Alto Networks can significantly change the trajectory. We believe that our ability to acquire, integrate and leverage our go-to-market for acquisitions is a strategic competitive advantage, and we expect to continue to be opportunistic to increase our long-term growth strategy., As I mentioned, Luis and I have spent a lot of time with all of you and you've highlighted that you love our business, some of you have questions with that our Firewall business is under pressure, others have wanted more transparency on our gross margins, while some of you wanted more visibility around ARR, eventually how to put it all together. Well, we heard you. It has taken a herculean effort to share our quarterly results in the shortest period we've ever done. But also to deliver detailed reporting on two categories, just to show that our business is doing extremely well. Let's take a look. , Over the last quarters, we have discussed our total Palo Alto Networks’ performance and provide the details for next-generation security and firewall as a platform. We had hoped that the firewall as a platform metric shows you how we're continuing to create share in the firewall space. The challenge has been that we did not provide anything below that number. What we decided to perhaps the best way to lay our concerns is show you the pro forma P&L around FwaaP and show you how it enjoys great margin. And it's actually higher quality business since we are transforming our hardware business to software and subscription business. We like this shift as software revenues of higher quality and increases revenue visibility. , Our next-generation security business, which has been the thrust of our innovation over the last two years, has been highlighted to share with you how we're building a bigger and better business faster than anyone else in next-generation security. , Next-generation security provides a perspective in our fast growing SaaS business on a billings basis, NGS’ nearly a quarter of total buildings up from 8% in FY 2018. NGS ARR closed Q1 at $719 million, up from $651 million of Q4 2020, and up from $568 million from Q3 2020. To provide a better understanding for business, we juggled a few pieces around. For our firewall as a platform business, we added the related subscription, support and professional services, we call it network security. , We removed the software firewall from NGS in order for the two areas to make a whole. We call this cloud & AI. With that context, we have prepared the recast of our full year guidance, which I just raised across both categories. Let's double click it network security. Our network security business on a standalone basis is still the largest firewall business in the industry by revenue. It enjoys double digit growth driven by transformation to solve for form factors. Our success in VMs and Prisma SASE and increased subscription attach. This has allowed us to have lesser and lesser reliance on hardware and provides better revenue visibility. We feel comfortable that these growth rates are robust and sustainable., Our gross margins and operating margins are extremely healthy. The gross margin was slightly less than where they could be because of our SASE gross margins, which given the early stage of that product, scale, relative firewalls, it has slightly lower margins. As we scale our SASE business and the new subscriptions we have launched, we expect these margins to improve over the next few years. Needless to say, these numbers speak for themselves. And on a standalone basis, this will be a very valuable network security business. , As we noted, our firewall business had largest industry, the industry leading financials, and we're going through a transformation. We will continue to invest in this transformation. Palo Alto Networks has already transformed into a highly ratable business, but ratable revenue as a percent of total revenue is up from 59% two years ago to 71% in Q1 2021., Now into Cloud & AI. This story has just started. If you ask every CIO, the two trends that they're all excited about are the transition to the cloud and the impact of AI. Well, there's no transformation unless there is a secure transformation. I think we have put the rest any questions on the idea that customers would get their cloud security from the CSPs only with 70% of the Fortune 100 being served by us. I think this is our opportunity to build upon. We're singularly focused on continuing to improve our platform to meet the needs of our customers as highlighted earlier. On the AI front, we're in the second iteration of this trend. The first trend was around collection of data and attempted to correlate it for security. The next trend which we are well poised to capture is a trend of normalized data, reduce the signal-to-noise ratio and to improve the security posture using data AI based practice security using Cortex., We have organized our financials for our cloud AI security category. This business, which we started building two years ago is getting traction or ensuring that we build this as a SaaS and ARR business. We expect ARR for Cloud &AI to grow 89% year-over-year in FY 2021., Even when excluding the Expanse contribution, we expect the growth to be 71% year-over-year. While the gross margins look lower in FY 2021 compared to FY 2020 partially because the integration of Crypsis, we expect that this business will continue to improve gross margins every year and improve significantly over the next three, four years., Operating margins will naturally improve as ratable revenue is recognized from the balance sheet to the P&L. We believe there's a large opportunity in Cloud & AI, and this could be the next $100 billion TAM in security. That said, we will continue to invest aggressively for this business., In summary, if you put it altogether, we have two great businesses doing exactly what we'd like them to do. In conclusion, we had a great fiscal quarter across the board. And as a result, we are raising our fiscal 2021 guidance. We've been building two businesses at Palo Alto Networks. Our Network Security business is a largest Firewall player with sustained gross margins and operating margins. And we have fast-growing Cloud & AI business where we expect FY 2020 on ARR of 89% year-over-year., Lastly, I am going to give you a quick update on what we call FLEXWORK, I started this morning by calling out the continued resilience of our employees throughout COVID-19, we have been supporting each and every employee with our FLEXWORK approach, a series of initiatives to give employees far greater choice as they adapt to the challenges this year in areas from work location, to benefits, to learning, all underpinned by the way we lead and communicate, with compassion and authenticity. We continue to advance this approach through Q1. We launched the first phase of FLEX benefits, giving our employees and additional $1,000 allowance for the year to choose from a wide range of wellbeing and childcare options., We roll out the first module of FLEX learn, an individualized learning path for our sales teams, leaders, managers, designed to support them as well as they work and lead remotely. We're delighted to see our FLEXWORK approach now gaining traction beyond Palo Alto Networks. Last month, we launched FLEXWORK at Zoomtopia, and invite other companies to join to open source discussions and share case studies and learnings. Over 600 attendees showed interest in the work. Simultaneously, the CEOs from Uber, Box, Splunk and Zoom all join me in formally announcing the FLEXWORK coalition, the community of leaders coming together, develop and share best practices as we focus on the future work. We all agree that pandemic has highlighted areas of opportunity, where we can bring about enduring workplace change., I look forward to continued conversations with these leaders and about how we can accelerate new work practices that put our employees of the center. , With that, I'll turn the call over to Luis., Luis Visoso, Thank you, Nikesh, and good morning to everyone. Before I start, I'd like to know that except for revenue and billings, all financial figures are non-GAAP and growth rates are compared to the prior year periods unless stated otherwise. As Nikesh indicated, we had a great first quarter as we delivered – as we continue to deliver winning innovation and add new customers. The strength gives us confidence to raise our guidance for the year. In Q1, total revenue grew 23% to $946 million. Looking at growth by geography, the Americas grew 27%, EMEA grew 16%, and APAC grew 11%., Q1 product revenue of $237 million, increased 3% compared to the prior year. Q1 subscription revenue of $428 million, increased 34%. Support revenue of $281 million, increased 26%. In total, subscription and support revenue of $709 million, increased 31% and accounted for 75% of total revenue., Turning to billings, Q1 total billings of $1.083 billion, net of acquired deferred revenue increased 21%. Strength was broad based, as we continue to see strong execution across the company. The dollar weighted contract duration for new subscriptions and support billings in the quarter was up slightly and remained at approximately three years. , Total deferred revenue at the end of Q1 was $3.9 billion, an increase of 31% year-over-year. Remaining Performance Obligation or RPO was $4.4 billion, an increase of 40% year-over-year. In addition to adding approximately 2,200 new customers in the quarter, we continue to increase our wallet share with existing customers. Our top 25 customers, 24 of which made a purchase this quarter, spend a minimum of $57.2 million in lifetime value through the end of fiscal Q1 2021, a 37% increase or the $41.7 million in the comparable prior year period. Q1 gross margin was 75.8%, which was down 80 basis points compared to last year, mainly driven by higher mix of our NGAs products, which are less mature., Q1 operating margin was 21.7%, an increase of 590 basis points year-over-year. The operating margin expansion is driven by operating expense leverage as we benefit from lower travel and event expenses due to COVID, which more than offset the incremental investment in headcount. We ended the first quarter with 8,376 employees, including 156 from Crypsis at the close of acquisition. , On a GAAP basis for the first quarter, net loss increased to $92.2 million or $0.97 per basic and diluted share. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter increased 51% to $158.1 million or $1.62 per diluted share. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for Q1 was 22%. , Turning to cash flow and balance sheet items. We finished October with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $4.1 billion. During the first quarter, we purchased $500 million or 2.1 million shares of common stock at an average price of approximately $242 per share. We have returned $2.7 billion to shareholders since Q1 2017 through the repurchase of programs and ASR where we repurchased 15.1 million shares of common stock at an average price of approximately $179 per share. Q1 cash flow from operations of $535 million, increased by 138% year-over-year. Free cash flow was $505 million, up 184% at a margin of 53.4%., As we mentioned last quarter, this was driven by the strong cash collections, following Q4 2020 record billings. DSO was 81 days, an increase of 18 days from the prior year period. We expect another strong collections quarter in Q2, which is expected to bring our DSO down to historical levels., Turning now to guidance and modeling points. For the second fiscal quarter of 2021, we expect billings to be in the range of $1.17 billion to $1.19 billion, an increase of 17% to 19% year-over-year. We expect revenue to be in the range of $975 million to $990 million, an increase of 19% to 21% year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $1.42 to a $1.44 using 98 million shares to a 100 million shares. , Additionally, I would like to provide some modeling points. We expect our Q2 non-GAAP effective tax rate to remain at 22%. CapEx in Q2 will be approximately $30 million to $35 million. As Nikesh reviewed earlier, for the full fiscal year 2021, we will be raising our guidance across all metrics. We expect billings to be in the range of $5.08 billion to $5.13 billion, an increase of 18% to 19% year-over-year. We expect next-generation security, ARR to be approximately $1.15 billion, an increase of 77% year-over-year., We expect revenue in the range of $4.09 billion to $4.14 billion, an increase over 20% year-over-year. We expect revenue – product revenue to be flat year-over-year. We expect operating margins to improve by 50 basis points year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $5.70 to $5 80 using 99 million to 101 million shares. Regarding free cash flow, for the full year, we expect an adjusted free flow margin of approximately 29%., With that, I’d like to open the call for questions., Question-and-Answer Session"

And I'm very pleased to be joined today by Linda Rendle, CEO of Clorox. Thank you for joining us, Linda., Linda Rendle, Happy to be here today. Thank you., Callum Elliott, Linda is going to make some brief introductory remarks I think before we head into Q&A, so just before that, some quick housekeeping. So on the left hand [technical difficulty] anonymously send us your own questions. And there should be a mechanism where you can vote for the questions that other investors have submitted. And I'll try and integrate those with my own Q&A as we go through. And just finally, on the right hand side of your screen, you should see a Procensus link, where you can submit feedback on our session today., And with that, let me hand it over to Linda, for introductory remarks., Linda Rendle, Hello, everyone, so great to have you with us today. I'm so pleased what the Clorox team has been able to do to serve more consumers around the world, given everything that's going on. And certainly evidenced by our last quarter performance where we were able to grow double-digits in 8 of our 10 business units. And as we look ahead, that is the singular opportunity we're focused on in serving more people around the world with our aspiration to accelerate the long-term performance of the company. And I know we'll have a good discussion about that today. And what we're focused on is playing 100% offense against those opportunities, where we see consumers who are changing their behaviors, they have different needs, and we're going to lean into our ignite strategy to help deliver on those. But with that, I know we're going to spend a lot of time on those Callum with questions. I'll turn it back to you., Question-and-Answer Session"

Hello, and good afternoon. Thank you for joining us today for our first public company earnings call. I hope you and your loved ones are safe and in good health in these difficult and turbulent times. , I want to begin by thanking the amazing team that got us to this point from our Founders 14 years ago to our employees around the world, our advisers and our new investors. And we would not be here today without our customers, the creators, the developers, the artists and the dreamers. We're looking forward to sharing details about Unity and our third quarter results with you today. , As many of you are aware, we capped our third quarter with a successful IPO that we conducted virtually. The IPO, or as we like to call it, the UPO, was the second largest software IPO in the last decade and was executed under an innovative structure which gave us better visibility and demand for optimal pricing and allocation. It also gave our employees the opportunity to sell a portion of their shares and vested options on day one of trading. We welcome all of our new shareholders here today. , Kim Jabal, our Chief Financial Officer, will detail financials in a few minutes. But before we dive in, I want to highlight three key points on our Q3 performance. First, despite several macro crosscurrents, we grew revenue 53% compared to Q3 of last year, and we generated a 79% non-GAAP gross margin. And our non-GAAP loss from operations was $8 million versus $28 million last year. , Second, the metrics that drove those numbers were good as well. One of the KPIs we focus on is dollar-based net expansion rate. And for the third quarter, that ratio hit 144%, thanks to a combination of strong execution and some tailwinds from COVID-induced work-from-home policies. And third, you can't deliver good financials without a strong foundation of innovative products and services as well as tuned go-to-market strategy. , Here are some of the interesting statistics. In the first nine months of 2020, we've seen an average of more than 5 billion downloads per month of applications built on Unity. And as of the end of Q3, we had approximately 2.5 billion monthly active end users who consumed content created or operated with our solutions. 94 of the top 100 game development companies by global revenue are Unity customers. And as of the end of Q3, 10 of the top 10 auto manufacturers are using Unity. , Unity is the world's leading platform for creating and operating interactive real-time 3D content. Creators and developers use Unity to build, to run and monetize interactive real-time 2D and 3D content for more than 20 different platforms, including mobile phones, tablets, PCs, consoles, and augmented and virtual reality devices. Much of the content consumed today, like TV and movies, website, social media, YouTube and Tiktok, is static or non interactive and/or 2D digital content. Real-time 3D interactive content allows end users to connect with the content and with each other. , Media built on Unity's real-time 3D platform gives users agency over their content, align them to control what they experience next, rather than being passive consumers of content. This interactivity, together with a full 3D perspective, allows for a fundamentally more engaging and immersive experience than traditional content does. We believe that most of the world's content will, in time, be real-time 3D, and it is our intent to be the driver towards this future. , Now it was a bold idea some years ago that a third-party engine like Unity could grow and ultimately be the technology under most of the world's games. And it is a bold idea today that industry after industry will convert from their 20th century dependence on non-interactive, low engagement 2D tools to embrace real-time 3D. Technologically, we build a single platform that enables our customers to build, to operate and monetize applications. , With Unity, you build an application once, and that application just works seamlessly on more than 20 platforms. Instead of mastering and porting their content to additional platforms, developers can focus on creating great content and on multiple path to success. And while there are blockbuster AAA games that cost $60 or more upfront, today, far more games are initially free-to-play, and that's great for consumers. , But game developers need some revenue to pay the bills. And they do this through in-game advertising and in-app purchases that make the game more engaging and more enjoyable. And that's where Operate services from Unity come into the picture. , Five years ago, we launched our monetization products. Unlike traditional adworks that optimize exclusively for eCPMs, we designed our platform to help our customers maximize engagement, enjoyment and the lifetime value or LTV of their users by leveraging unique data and proprietary AI tools. This might sound like a relatively easy task, but it was not. We started with a few hundred thousand player behavior data points. But with a lot of work, we gradually built one of the leading data networks for gaming. , We've reached the scale where we ingest 60 billion in-app events per day. This data helps us deliver better LTV and lower cost to acquire for our customers. And this has helped us build one of the largest monetization platforms focused on the games market. We also offer additional Operate solutions, including deltaDNA and user engagement, Multiplay, cloud hosting and Orchestration and in game communications through Vivox. , Today, these technologies mostly apply to gaming, but we see many opportunities to extend our platform into other industry verticals in the future. We are a market share leader and have strong healthy growth opportunities across the Board, both in Create and our Operate businesses. We're not resting on our laurels. We have big ambitions. First, we continue to focus on our core gaming market and believe we can increase our business in this sector significantly in the coming years by continuing to innovate and leverage our data advantage and adding new Create and Operate tools and services. , Beyond gaming, we began to focus on new verticals just a few years ago. We're growing into new verticals like industrial, automotive, architecture, engineering and entertainment, rapidly solving more and more customer problems and identifying more and more use cases. And while we're gaining rapidly in these sectors, we are also examining new industries to enter and expand. , Let me give you a few examples. Toyota worked with Unity to create a mixed reality system for diagnostics and repairs for their dealerships and service networks. This was a high-stakes decision because repairs have a big impact on brand perception. Toyota used to manually tag 20,000 pictures to ingest them into a learning algorithm, a process that took about 200 hours. Toyota turned to Unity to build accurate 3D models of the body and engine compartment. This reduced Toyota's workflow time to 30 minutes, a 400 times reduction. , Valerio Dewalt Train was invited to build on the design of a 36 storey, 390 foot tall Bell Tower and Bell Park Office Building in Denver, Colorado. This was a complicated project, because the location and the size of the tower mattered to city planners. Valerio deployed our architecture product, Unity Reflect, to geolocate the building on site and develop an augmented Reality digital twin. By using Reflect, Valerio Dewalt Train built a prototype in less than four weeks and won the bid with the city. , Now I want to wrap with a discussion of what we hope to turn into a tradition on these earnings calls, a brief highlight of some of the new innovative products that our development teams have built. In September, we launched the LEGO Microgame, a free to use set of modules that allows entry-level users to build and share their first 3D game in less than an hour, using a simple no-code interface. , In adding the LEGO Microgame to our growing portfolio of templates that help new users to start creating successfully, we believe the low-code, no-code market will become a substantial part of Unity's business in the years ahead. And we are grateful to work with such a well-regarded brand to help bridge the gap between physical products and the virtual world. And for Unity, we have built a low friction on-ramp for budding new game designers. , In Q4, we're launching another application specifically designed for verticals outside of gaming. It's called Forma. And it's an example of our ability to build technically advanced applications that are intuitive and easy to use. The shift to working from home has accelerated the move to virtual commerce. Meanwhile, today's shoppers are more sophisticated, and they expect to see their visions come to life in real time. And this is where Forma comes in. , One use case for Forma, as an example, is an automotive manufacturer that creates advertisements, product guides and a car configurator that are engaging, interactive and in real-time 3D. This gives customers a much richer visualization for their potential purchase, including colors, fabrics and accessories. In that way, Forma gives marketers a tool to differentiate themselves from their competition. , We've made great progress, but we are just getting started. At Unity, we believe the world is a better place with more creators in it. And we intend to realize this belief by making real-time interactive 3D, the dominant form of content worldwide. As a company, we will invest for the long-term to ensure we deliver for our customers the Unity developer. And through this long-term investment orientation, we aim to drive significant growth for many years to come. We welcome our new shareholders on this journey. , Now let me turn over the discussion to Kim Jabal, our CFO, to go through our financial results. , Kim Jabal , Thank you, John, and thank you all for joining us on our first earnings call. This is an exciting time, and I want to echo John's thanks to the entire Unity team for their hard work and dedication that has led us to this moment. We are very pleased to have started our public company life with such a strong quarter. , Let me begin by reviewing our financial results. Revenue for the third quarter of 2020 was $201 million compared with $131 million in the third quarter of 2019. This is an increase of 53% year-over-year. Our revenue mix has shifted in 2020 towards Operate Solutions, with Operate, Create And Strategic partnerships accounting for 60%, 31% and 9% of revenue, respectively, in Q3. , One of our key metrics, dollar-based net expansion rate, sustained its recent high levels, coming in at 144% compared to 132% as of September 30, 2019. Please do note that some of our expansion in 2020 was driven by COVID tailwinds in the Operate business, and this may result in a tough compare in 2021. Drilling down into our operating groups, Create revenue grew 45% to $63 million. While the first half of the year introduced some COVID related headwinds and as game developers adapted to work from home environments and deal cycles slowed, we saw recovery in Q3 in our Create business. , Our customers are turning to Unity to help them create and build everything in real-time 3D, from the next-generation of office buildings, to self-driving cars, to the video games enjoyed by millions of people around the world. Operate Solutions had a very strong quarter, growing 72% versus last year. These results reflect strong execution and product improvements, alongside higher end user engagement with games built by our customers. This is driven in part by COVID tailwinds. , Our Operate Solutions are aligned with the success of our customers. This is really important. When our customers grow their engagement with their end users, when they grow their revenues through the use of our monetization tools, they grow their usage of our services, and this drives our revenue growth. , Strategic partnerships revenue was flat with last year at $18 million. This reflect slower deal cycles driven by COVID as well as the sunsetting of certain products within our partners' portfolios. This revenue line remains very strategic for us, but it can be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter in terms of growth. , Non-GAAP gross margin was 79%. This compares to 81% in the third quarter of last year and 78% in the second quarter of 2020. The year-over-year decline was due primarily to higher professional services, driving growth in new verticals with the acquisition of Finger Food in April, as well as increased hosting costs to meet the demands and growth from our Operate Solutions business. , Non-GAAP loss from operations for the third quarter was $8 million or negative 4% of revenue compared to a non-GAAP loss from operations of $28 million or negative 21% of revenue in the same period last year. A substantial part of the year-over-year improvement was driven by onetime savings that we recognized related to COVID, primarily related to travel, events and facilities. , Now turning to our guidance. So to set the context, I want to reiterate that 2020 has been a pretty unusual year with lots of uncertainty related to COVID. We aren't counting on our normal Q4 seasonal jump in our Operate Solutions business as we believe the increase in user engagement that typically happens around the Q4 holidays has essentially already happened. And in addition, additional uncertainty for our game development customers occurred with this year's announcement from Apple of new policies for the IDFA, which was originally slated for introduction in Q4, but is now delayed until sometime in 2021. , From an expense perspective, we are expecting to reinvest some of the material COVID-driven OpEx savings that we achieved throughout the year into incremental marketing programs and hiring in R&D and sales in order to continue to drive our revenue growth. So for the fourth quarter, we expect revenue of $200 million to $204 million and a non-GAAP loss of operations of $35 million to $40 million or approximately 17% to 20% as a percent of revenue. , Our revenue outlook for the full fiscal year ending December 31, 2020 is $752 million to $756 million. This is up from $542 million in 2019, reflecting year-over-year growth of 39% to 40%. We expect non-GAAP loss from operations for all of 2020 to be $66 million to $71 million or approximately 9% as a percent of revenue, down from $92 million in 2019. , We expect the weighted average fully diluted share count to be approximately 321 million for the fourth quarter. I'd like to point out that Q3 free cash flow of positive $11 million benefited from strong performance within our Operate Solutions business, alongside an increase in net working capital. Although we're not guiding free cash flow, you should expect it to remain volatile quarter-to-quarter, and we expect to drop back into negative free cash flow in Q4. , And that concludes my prepared remarks. So thank you, again, to the entire Unity team for the hard work that has led us to this point. And thank you to all of our new shareholders. We are honored that you have decided to join us on this journey. And with that, John and I are now happy to take your questions. Richard? , Question-and-Answer Session"

Please be aware that for the sake of the infection control, we are going to ask everyone to connect on the online basis. We are operating this conference with minimal staff. Please be aware that we purposely take off our masks to make sure that our voices are heard clearly. , Presenters today are Mr. Ishibashi Shu -- Shu Ishibashi, Global CEO and Representative Executive Officer; also, we have Mr. Naoki Hishinuma, Corporate Officer, Global CFO, two executives to give you the presentations. First, starting with Global CFO presentation to be given by Mr. Hishinuma., Naoki Hishinuma, Thank you very much. This is Hishinuma, Global CFO. Thank you very much for gathering on the occasion of the announcement of financial results for the third quarter fiscal 2020. If you go to Bridgestone's homepage, there are presentation materials uploaded, and this we'll please make reference to that. And this is my agenda today. First and foremost, to start with business and financial performance for third quarter fiscal 2020. First, impacts from COVID-19 in the third quarter fiscal 2020. The global tire market for both new vehicles and replacement recovered in the third quarter, particularly for replacement tires in U.S. and Europe as well as in China. For mining tires, while mine operating conditions varied among minerals overall slowed -- showed the signs of weakness. PSR high rim diameters above 18 inches, the relative strength in demand continued to stand out and sales recovered to a higher level than in the previous year in the third quarter. , Supply chain conditions. All plants which were temporarily suspended in the second quarter have already resumed their operations. The impact of the shortened operation hours and some store closures has been largely resolved, but we continue to operate while minimizing the risk of COVID-19 infection. Under such circumstances, the company in the third quarter implemented thorough expense and cost control under crisis management based on cash-oriented operations. Also, the company promoted to reform expense and cost restructure -- cost structure to ""rebuild earning power."" Port Elizabeth plant in South Africa, the operation started in August, which led to the closure agreement in November, as was recently announced. And for Bethune plant in France, a project of plant closure initiated in September. The company has been developing our own HRX plan, looking to the establishment of execution system for mid-long term business strategy, and the details of this will be explained by our Global CEO, Mr. Ishibashi. , Turning to the performance results in Q3. Business environment. Currency exchange. Japanese yen was stronger against the U.S. dollar and weaker against euro versus the previous year. Raw material prices, both natural rubber and crude oil, rose sharply from the second quarter when the market fell. Tire demand, both replacement and OE segments recovered significantly and particularly so in the replacement segment of the market., Tire sales growth for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 versus the previous year. 9 months unit sales globally was 78% for PSR/LTR and TBR 81% year-on-year. Both PSR and TBR unit sales in the 3 months of the third quarter recovered to roughly 90% year-on-year. Replacement tire sales recovery was relatively strong. And for above 18-inch PSR, HRD, high rim diameter tires, recovery in Europe and U.S. enabled recovery to the level exceeding in the prior year. ORR tires, through the second quarter, the strength was preserved into the third quarter. Stagnant economy adversely impacted mining operations and no further recovery was seen from the second quarter level. , Now to explain the consolidated results for third quarter of fiscal 2020. Revenue for 9 months was for ¥2,148.9 billion, down slightly less than 20% year-on-year. Adjusted operating profit, ¥118.4 billion, was down year-on-year. In the third quarter, sales recovered significantly from the second quarter, which dipped largely. So that both revenue and adjusted operating profit returned to the level above the first quarter and the adjusted operating profit ratio improved to 8.8%. On the other hand, profit attributable to owners of parent, due to nonrecurring losses, such as impairment losses, for the 9-month period, the figure was ¥24.1 billion negative. In subsequent pages, by the way, I will explain about nonrecurring losses and others for this fiscal year. , Analysis of adjusted operating profit for the third quarter of fiscal 2020. Under severe business conditions, fundamental cost review and containment were executed. While with the preservation of selling prices, spread between the selling price and raw material costs contributed to increased profits. On the other hand, large drop in sales volume and the worsening of conversion costs, which is part of the so-called others company, reduced the profits. As a result, consolidated adjusted operating profit decreased by ¥138.8 billion. , Financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 by segment. In the third quarter, in Americas, Europe and China, market conditions recovered, but not to the prior year levels. So all segments decreased revenue and adjusted operating profit for the third quarter 3 months as well over the 9 months period. In Europe, Russia, Middle East, India and Africa, 3 months in the third quarter returned to be profitable, but not enough to overtake losses from the first half and 9 months results were in the red. , Financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 by product in the core tire business. Passenger car and light truck tires revenue for the 9-month period was ¥1,018 billion with the adjusted OP ratio of 5.3%. Truck and bus tires revenue, ¥472.2 billion with the adjusted OP ratio of 7.0%. Although in the 3 months of the third quarter, sales recovery in U.S., Europe and the sales of high rim diameter above 18 inches in the passenger car and light truck category increased, among others was recurring double-digit the adjusted OP ratio. In the meantime, hospitality tires, including the ORR, aircraft, agriculture and motorcycle tires, the 3 months total although was bearish for the sales of mining tires and 9 months adjusted OP ratio, however, stood strong after all. , Next, Diversified Products Business. 9 months Diversified Products Business revenue was ¥378.6 billion with the adjusted operating profit of negative ¥2.5 billion. Backed by strong Diversified Products Business in Americas centered around roofing materials, the 3 months adjusted profit for the Diversified Products Business was just shy of ¥7 billion. However, chemical and industrial products business in Japan, while the business portfolio issues have been persisting, not to mention the impact of COVID-19 this year, suffered from the reduced demand from OE and/or mining accounts and severe conditions continued. , Balance sheet and cash flow highlights for the third quarter fiscal 2020. Total assets, ¥4,111.6 billion. Funding to secure liquidity increased cash at hand by more than ¥200 billion. On the other hand, decrease in accounts receivable, inventory, not to mention tangible assets and the investment securities caused total assets to decrease by ¥165.5 billion from December end of 2019. Equity ratio came down by 3.1 percentage points at 51.8%, still maintaining the healthy status. , Free cash flow. With expense and cost review, scrutiny over the selection of CapEx, inventory control and others, though the environment was quite severe, we landed at ¥173.4 billion cash in. Nonrecurring items. In the third quarter, the new China TBR business impairment losses was incurred and also provisions relating to the commencement of discussions for the closure of overseas tire plants. So for the 9 months total, on the IFRS basis, the total amount of adjusted items was ¥75 billion. , Next, I would like to share with you the consolidated projections for fiscal 2020. Business environment for year. Currency exchange assumptions, as you see here. Raw material prices in the final quarter, natural rubber price to rise sharply with the crude oil to remain at the same level as in the third quarter. Tire demand. Demand slowed down in the final quarter, mainly in U.S. and Europe due to the emerging impact of the second wave of COVID-19. Moderate recovery expected in Japan for both replacement and OE segments. In Asia, China and Thailand on recovery, but Indonesia still hit significantly by COVID-19. , Tire sales growth projections for fiscal 2020. Both for passenger car and light truck and the truck and bus tires, global sales is projected to decrease by a little less than 20%. We assume that due to the second wave of the COVID-19, mainly in U.S. and Europe, there will be demand slowing for the final quarter. Sales of the HRD tires above 18 inches in the final quarter will be lower than in the third quarter, even though the replacement segment sales of HRD will be only slightly lower than in the previous year. ORR tires, final quarter, though, we continue to be bearish than prior year, mainly as a result -- as relates to coal mines, so full year sales of ultra-large, large, small and medium ORR tires are projected to be a little less than 20% lower in sales. , Consolidated projections for fiscal 2020. Revenue, ¥2,890 billion, which is a little less than 20% lower. Adjusted operating profit is projected at ¥150 billion. By the way, the variance analysis of the adjusted operating profit will be on the following page. Profit attributable to owners of parent, which remained to be determined as of August on the basis of the company's stance to book impairment losses from less profitable businesses or recognizing expenses for business restructuring now not foregoing the actions, resulted in the ¥60 billion negative for year. , Analysis of adjusted operating profit for fiscal 2020. Improved spread between price and raw materials and benefits, which have come through the thorough review of expenses will contribute positively, while full year decrease in volume and the worsening of conversion costs in others category will noticeably drag the profitability. Thus, the company projects the consolidated adjusted operating profit to decrease by ¥185.7 billion. , Last but not least, I will discuss the revision of the forecast for the year-end dividend. Our company positions the interest of our shareholders as an important issue in our business management. And it is our basic policy to work to improve our financial performance while reinforcing the foundation of the management to be prepared for the future development of the business. In regard to distributing profits to shareholders, we conduct shareholder returns while maintaining an appropriate financial position and securing the internal revenues necessary for future growth investments., In determining dividend payments, we comprehensively evaluate factors, including business results, financial conditions for the relevant fiscal period, medium-term earnings forecast, investment plans and cash flows. Based on these considerations, we strive to live up to expectations of shareholders by issuing stable dividend payments, targeting at consolidated payout ratio of 20% to 40%. , Considering the difficult financial status we find ourselves in with a negative net income forecast for 2020, as explained, series of discussions were held internally, while being mindful of the need to secure fund for future growth, the likelihood of future increase in demand for financing relating to business manufacturing base reorganization, the need to continue to maintain a robust cash position and the policy of stable shareholder returns in the mid-long term. As a result, the year-end dividend forecast was determined as ¥55 per share and the total annual dividend ¥105 per share. I'd like to ask for your kind understanding. , And that's all for me. Thank you for your kind attention., Unidentified Company Representative, That was the presentation on the financial results of the third quarter of fiscal 2020 by Hishinuma. Next, I'd like to invite Shu Ishibashi, Global CEO and Representative Executive Officer, to present mid-long term business strategy update., Shuichi Ishibashi, Hello, everyone. I'm Shu Ishibashi, Global CEO and Representative Executive Officer of Bridgestone Corporation. Following the financial results, I will provide an update on the mid-long term business strategy. In July, August and September of this year, I provided a whole picture and update on our mid-long term business strategy. This is our global midterm business scenario. Our aim is to evolve to a strong Bridgestone by 2023 that is leaner and capable of quickly adapting to changes in the business environment. To do so, we need to transform while taking advantage of our strengths in order to realize our new growth strategy., We are accelerating this transformation and clarifying our strategic focus through the execution of 3 stages: crisis management in order to address the impact of COVID-19 for the remainder of this year and into next year; rebuilding earnings power, we've already started focusing on this in our core business; strategic growth investment in order to support the expansion of the Solutions Business into growth business. In order to execute this transformation, we initiated the following structured process: development of global KPIs and PDCA process to track and measure our progress; development of a new management index, including measurement of ROIC as the foundation of our evolving financial strategy. Also, as enablers for execution, we are accelerating Bridgestone's human resource transformation or HRX. Our people are the most important component of execution. , First, rebuilding earnings power. Here is how we control expense or OpEx under the crisis management mode in 2020. We managed strict expense control throughout 2020 in this severe business environment and also started tackling expense structure reformation to contribute in mid-long term range. As a result of these actions, we have secured ¥75 billion savings of fixed expense versus 2019. Within this total amount, ¥50 billion was saved by strict expense control under crisis management, for example, furloughs in retail and manufacturing to adjust production volume decrease., Another ¥25 billion was saved through initiatives to expense structure reformation, which will also contribute in the mid-long term range, for example, in the area of resource allocation and organizational restructuring. As for variable expenses, we are tackling logistics optimization to reduce expenses. However, we believe this is not enough. We will continue to focus on business portfolio restructuring over the next several years to initiate robust structural reformation. , Regarding operating expense, OpEx, we have changed the structure of fixed expense to be leaner and are already seeing positive results. This leaner fixed expense structure will be the new base going forward. We have already initiated a strategic reallocation of resources and overall restructuring of the organization and modification of a part of our compensation strategy. These changes will be aligned with our HRX strategy. As for advertising and sales promotion, we will optimize resources based on our brand strategy and in alignment with the mid-long term business strategy., Also, we will evaluate our sales channels and organizations to allow for our Solutions Business expansion, and this will contribute to reduction of sales expenses. As for variable expense, our main focus is currently on reforming our logistics operations. Combined with restructuring activities within our sales channel, our distribution system will be refined, and we'll be able to optimize our distribution centers and achieve more efficient deliveries, among other benefits. In addition, we aim to improve group internal logistics costs in connection with the movement of products, in particular, resulting in the optimization of routes between sites and lower cost per delivery. , We anticipate these results will be achieved through our activities to reduce fixed costs in 2 years from 2020 to 2021, mainly in HR and organization areas. Approximately ¥3 billion will be reduced in 2 years through the adaptation of compensation strategy initiated in Japan and our overseas SBUs. We have initiated resource reallocation in every region. Voluntary separation programs in overseas SBUs and utilizing outsourcing and shared services in administrative jobs will contribute approximately ¥9 billion to fixed expenses reduction in 2 years. As for integration of office facilities, we have initiated activities globally based on new ways of working as well as in Japan. From these initiatives, the reduction of fixed expense in total will be approximately ¥13 billion. We will move forward to achieve further improvements as we transform to a leaner structure, and we expect the benefits of these activities will continue to contribute to our earning power in 2022 onward. , Here is some information about the integration of our office facilities in Japan. Triggered by COVID-19, changes to how we work have been accelerated. We have been discussing ways to adjust our systems to new ways of working to ensure our teammates' peace of mind and safety. We have decided to integrate office sites and expand support of our remote work environment in order to realize our new ways of working, which will be a combination of remote work and working in the offices. Starting in January 2021, we will begin to reduce our office sites in the Tokyo Metropolitan Area and in large regional cities such as Osaka, Nagoya and Sapporo by 30% versus our current office footprint. This will support the expansion of remote work and optimization of office space usage, which means better utilization of owned estate and reduction of rental space. , Expected total benefit from this integration will be ¥800 million of expense reduction in 2021. These new integrated offices will provide social distance options and ensure our teammates' peace of mind of safety. As for remote work, we are encouraging TQM, total quality management, activities to increase productivity and maximize value creation, and we tend to share best practices of value creation and innovation globally. Also, as remote work became a regular work option, this past October, we began providing an allowance to support the remote work environment, and we'll modify our commuting expense plan to better reflect this new style of working. , Next, I will explain about initiatives to improve production cost. We are focused on every element of production cost at every site globally. About raw materials costs, a global procurement project is ongoing. The initiatives will expand global sourcing and central purchasing and also review and evaluate current raw materials and switch them to better and more cost-effective ones. Through these measures, we will be able to cope with expected raw material cost increase, driven by anticipated economic recovery in 2021. About our Dan-Totsu product strategy, we have expected plans to achieve both improvements in cost, while at the same time, implementing activities to increase product power such as commonality and modularity., Regarding initiatives to improve conversion cost, we're also exploring further cost improvements in our manufacturing operations. We're reviewing all issues in every plant and setting improvement KPIs. Based on these KPIs, we'll take measures to improve productivity through the PDCA cycle. Also, we are approaching this by considering both tangible factors and intangible factors. The tangible factors include maximizing the use of existing equipment to reduce unnecessary additional investment in our plants. The intangible factors are based on our fundamental policy of manufacturing., To manage manufacturing is to develop people there, and we will strengthen it through activities that will include the deployment of talent from the headquarters and the Kodaira technical center to SBUs to support plants globally. As our European group company, Bridgestone EMEA, has already communicated publicly, they have initiated 2 planned closure projects. The project of Bethune plant is pending works council consultation. Regarding the closure of Port Elizabeth plant, we reached an agreement and is planning to close the plant on November 15. Optimization of our manufacturing footprint based on strategy will be continuously considered and evaluated. , Now I'll explain about building the foundation of our financial strategy in HRX as enablers for execution. We've enhanced the foundation of our financial strategy, which is very important for rebuilding earnings power and expanding our Solutions Business. Through portfolio management, we've structured our base for evaluation strategies by business portfolio and have added ROIC as a new management index to support strategic decisions, which may include the possibility of existing business. In addition, we've enhanced the function of finance as a global control function to better manage investment in plants and M&A globally, and we have adjusted structural resources, rules and policies accordingly. This enhancement of the financial foundation enables us to follow-up with the PDCA cycle and evaluate our execution progress. Our business portfolio management will be also enhanced. , Next, I would like to discuss Bridgestone's HRX. In the core tire and rubber business, we know that we face challenges, are in the process of addressing a fundamental cultural transformation to leverage our strength. As for the growth business, we are creating a new culture with our new teammates from Webfleet Solutions and iTrack, something that will help us be successful in the development and sustainability of Solutions Business. Through the transformation of our core business, we will generate the resources necessary to flexibly invest and reallocate to our growth business. We will also adapt the new culture of our growth business to our core business to make it stronger, thereby amplifying the value of each business, the value spiral up work here as well., I would like to first explain the existing challenges and HRX direction of the core business culture transformation. The challenges we are facing globally are mainly four. First, there has been insufficient linkage of business strategy in HR and organization strategy. Next, in our SBU system, where each SBU executive business executes business in its region automatically, the balance of responsibility has become ambiguous. And as a result, performance management, including investment control, in particular, has not been strong enough. In addition, we recognize that lack of future management talent in many areas and increased fixed cost on global level are also our challenges., Towards these challenges, anchored in and starting from a business strategy, we built an aligned HR and organizational strategy to secure group level optimization. We have qualified global and local strategies and global KPI and achieve stronger grip through the Global EXCO, which will evolve global management, glocal management. We have also qualified the global and local responsibilities of our global management team and linked performance to pay and incentives. And also, we have accelerated and expanded our focus on the development of future management talent. For example, we have selected BRIDGESTONE NEXT100. , Regarding the challenges to reduce fixed cost, as I introduced earlier, we have started fundamental strategic restructuring and personnel optimization activities. As for Japan, we recognize that it is a big challenge to break away from the traditional organizational structure and culture. We have a unique system in Japan, where evaluation and promotion is made based on mainly seniority and with focus on performance., And perhaps uniquely to Bridgestone, we have a bloated and inefficient organization, slow decision-making and silos across our organization. We also realized that we must effectively develop global management capabilities and enhance our focus on attracting, retaining and developing and promoting diverse talent. In order to fundamentally improve these challenges in Japan, we have introduced a new HR system to: one, make organization simple and lean; and also to adopt a job-focused employment concept and enhance talent development. , Let me explain the new system on the following side. First of all, we revised our organizational design to enable a firm, lean, quick and simple organization and decision-making. The organizational layer is revised from 5 to basically 3, composed of senior officer, executive and management layers. We've eliminated the existing executive officer system and reduced the number of leader positions, mainly in the core business, by about 20%. The senior officer layer is composed of only vice president and senior officers, and we have reduced the number of officers from the current 60 to about 20. We issued a letter to those who have been appointed as a vice president and senior officer to qualify their role and responsibility. It is 1-year term and is updated annually., In order for individuals with advanced knowledge, skills in a specific area to contribute in the right position, we created a new specialist position in addition to the leader position. The specialist contributes to the business with their knowledge and experience without responsibility for management. The transfers between the 2 positions, specialists and leader, are intended to be flexible to realize agile utilization based on ability and performance. In this way, we are able to optimize personnel as well as achieve a simple and lean organization. We are also able to generate resources through reducing positions in our core business and flexibly reallocate roles to improve and expand our global business. , Next, I would like to address the concept of matching of people with position based on the business strategy. Until now, our HR system was based on a membership-based employment concept. Now we are seeking a more hybrid employment system by partially adopting a job-focused employment concept in our growth business. This is represented by a concept of matching of people with position. We firstly clarify required functions and organizational abilities to execute the business strategy, and based on them, clarify position requirements and HR requirements and then identify the right person to take the appropriate position., We also will enhance talent development and recruitment activities to identify the best candidate to meet position requirements. Also, we've revised the unique Japanese evaluation reward system, which is based mainly on seniority, to a more fair one, aligned to role and responsibilities and performance. For officers and managers, we've introduced position-based evaluation promotion, 360-degree assessment, et cetera. And for staff personnel, we eliminated the regular annual salary increase system and introduced a new system which evaluates outcome and progress in a fair manner. With this organizational reform, we expect these new system to foster motivation and growth of our teammates. , And finally, regarding one of the most important elements, talent development, we have initiated new approaches based on the new organization and people matching concept. In the past, our main focus was to minimize variability to maximize organizational ability based on the membership-based employment concept. But for the future, as we adopt the job-focused employment concept, we aim to maximize individual capacity or capability, so that each teammate can work to his or her fullest ability in the right position through learning and development activities that are customized to each individual's unique strengths and needs. Regarding development programs, basics are to align with the clear HR requirements. The programs are designed to focus on improving practical ability and performance and creating opportunities. Top management and division heads are responsible for providing these opportunities., As an initiative to develop future management talent, this year, we introduced the BRIDGESTONE NEXT100 system to select and develop future management talent, about 100 globally in total with about 30 from Japan. We are also continuing our focus on promoting diversity and inclusion. Diversity and diverse viewpoints are indispensable if we are to successfully expand our growth business. We have been enhancing recruitment and development of diverse talent. And as one of our challenges that require immediate attention in Japan, we will focus on promoting female managers and improving their support system through initiatives such as mentoring system. , So those were the new culture regarding the core system, but from here, I will explain about the Solutions Business organizations. As I mentioned earlier, we need to create a new culture to accelerate our Solutions Business expansion. First, we've structured our Solutions Business organization globally. The Global Solutions Committee directly reporting to G-EXCO consists of members from all SBUs to monitor and align the business expansion. They also propose strategy and actions through G-EXCO, as appropriate. We structured Bridgestone T&DPaaS organization in the global HQ and the Kodaira technical center to manage the whole picture of Bridgestone Solutions Business and will take initiative for global alignment., And under the centers of excellence model, which is a unique system where a region which has a strong position in particular aspect of our Solution Business leads the business globally, each Solution Business organization has been structured to reinforce its role and capability. In Europe, we have the Bridgestone Mobility Solutions business unit with integration of Webfleet Solutions organization and tire-centric solutions team. In America, we have developed focused retread and mobility solutions organization to accelerate Solutions Business. In Japan, Bridgestone Tire Solution Japan is focused on identifying ways to accelerate the Solutions Business. And for mining and aircraft solutions, we have an independent business unit to lead global business expansion. Step-by-step, Solutions Business will be strengthened and expanded. , We also have strategic partnership and M&A organization in Europe and the United States to maximize new value creation and value co-creation for the growth business. In addition, we launched a global strategic partnership M&A project, which reports directly to the Global CEO for scouting and execution based on business strategy. In this project, we are exploring new business opportunities to enhance our solutions, digital transformation and sustainability initiatives, investment in start-ups and venture capitals to further strengthen the scouting function. Building a global M&A funding system, we will allocate necessary resources in our midterm business plan. With this global organization base, we will further accelerate and expand our Solutions Business. , This is what we wanted to discuss today. As I started -- stated at the start of this presentation, we have started the execution phase based on this midterm business scenario towards 2023. And as we look towards 2030, we have firmly placed sustainability at the core of our business and management and will accelerate business development to contribute to the circular economy. An important component of this approach is based on three Rs: reduce, reuse and recycle. Through our core business, which produces and sells tire and rubber products, we will strive to continuously reduce raw materials use., And through our growth business, we will provide value solutions to customers who use our products and services. We reuse tires as well, for example, retread tire services. In addition, we will increase focus on recycling or further integrate recycling into a business model, so that we will be able to amplify the value of tires fully throughout the value chain, and we will have unique circular economy business model, which we aim to establish. And the final target is to realize our 2050 vision, whereby Bridgestone continues to provide social value and customer value as a sustainable solution company. , Lastly, on February next year, we will announce our midterm business plan in direction looking towards 2030 based on midterm -- mid-long term business strategy, which I have explained. As updates throughout this year, I will explain the plan, along with the action, including financials and other data for 3 years at the time. Midterm business plan was redesigned to execute strategy in a steadier and more strategically consistent manner globally than previous midterm management plan. Including announcement of midterm business plan through very -- every communication opportunity, I will continue to provide visibility of our plans and results to deliver on our growth., Thank you for your time today and for your understanding and continued support., Unidentified Company Representative, Thank you, Mr. Ishibashi. We have just given you the presentation from Mr. Ishibashi on mid-long term business strategy update., Question-and-Answer Session"

Thank you for joining us, Tim. The uranium market has seen -- yes, thank you. The uranium market has seen a lot of action this year. And Cameco actually, I think has been in really solid financial position basically at near zero net debt. And so, I think it's a great time to catch-up on the story. Tim, I think you're -- once you have some opening remarks first. And then we'll jump into Q&A. If anyone from the audience has any questions, you can type it into the question box and then we'll pass it on. So, Tim, why don't you take it?, Tim Gitzel, Super well, Andrew, thank you very much and good morning everybody with you. Today, I hope you and your families are doing well through this pandemic both mentally and physically. We said here, there's no playbook for the year, we show up every morning that we see what's in front of us and we invest in and I'm really happy that team has done a really good job through the Cigar Lake down for a while. [Indiscernible] with all of the precautions that we need to do so we'll keep we'll keep doing that, but it's not easy times., And it's actually your team at RBC for putting on this conference, we did refer very much to be face-to-face with you in-person for a while yet. And so, we're going to have to get used to this format. And so hopefully, I can get to get our message out through this medium today. I prepared a few comments. After that, I'd like to just run through and give you a little bit of a flavor of what's going on what we're thinking about here Cameco and then we're delighted to have some quick questions., At the end of the same story for us, despite the COVID and everything else that's going on, what gets us up in the morning is knowing that despite COVID elections and everything else going on in the world population continues to grow, we're at seven point something billion today expecting another 2 billion people on the planet. In the next in the next couple of decades, a billion of those people today don't have access to electricity and 2 billion more come onto the planet that one need deserve than are going to get on having electricity., And what we're seeing different now is, it's not just any electricity, they want clean electricity, they want carbon free electricity and that's the plant. And so, these are two blocks that really we're seeing a big move to a foundation of energy sources in the world innovation piece, and I was going to give everybody a test this morning and just say tell me how many countries, states, provinces companies, big ones commitment become carbon neutral by pick year date 2030, 2040, 2050 even China 2060, and diamond about fraction of the world fossil fuel generated., And it's just enormous asset in front of us. Two-thirds of China's electricity is from fossils today and by 2060, they're going to be carbon neutral. I mean, just to say, the goal is enormous. Plus we heard that the other day and I think you've heard us on a conference call say, in Florida they want to have 25 million electric vehicles on the road by 2030. And there's no use putting those on if you're going to fire them with coal-fired electricity, if you're going to charge them with coal-fired electricity., And so, that challenge is out that, put some numbers on that, and we think and we heard from some Chinese scientists that that would require about 200 reactors in China alone just to power those vehicles. And so, you can see the size of the challenge, 200 reactors that's 100 million pounds of uranium for a year for China. Today, they have a boat 50% or 25 to 30 million pounds and that's going to go up ironically and we are waiting for their five year plan or 14th five-year plan, which you think will focus on nuclear., So those pieces are out there. Rest of the world is still moving in at 453 reactors another 50 under construction. I was looking at your numbers presented in morning, before I came in to report I read a very good report, draining demand to grow from 171 where it is today to somewhere 100 in nine years, not long from now. And I think we look at that. If you look at, there's over 700 million pounds of uranium still procure that are out there that has to be purchased from somebody. And so, the U.S. is number 716. So, you had another year, which isn't long from now and you're over a billion over a billion pounds this year., So, supply this year at about 120 million pound and 171 demand that you are going to have a deficit this year because of the shut down due to COVID in other words. So, these are just some of the things that of get us excited that in the morning, you're not seeing any investments in new mines right now and nobody is [Indiscernible] cut U.S. read U.S. read trade tech, read anybody, do your own studies, that's have new mines at 30 bucks aren't going to go. And so, nobody's really investing in anything new., So, I'd say, these are things that keep us on our track on our strategy and keep us doing what we said we would do. And so, what did we say we would do, first we said, we're going to protect our employees. We're going protect our employees and the communities around them. It wasn't easy to take down safe guard. Right now, we're operating well with a whole bunch of employees in place but -- we're seeing the numbers, especially Northern Saskatchewan with a bit of concern., On the operational side, we've implemented this over the last, what is it under five years now. It was 2016 when we first took down Rabbit Lake in the U.S. pull back it. And then in 2017, we made the big decision to take down McArthur Key completely, which was probably one of the toughest decisions in my career, but what is the 70 pounds in the ground that sort of come out. On the marketing side, we're purchasing and Grant in his team I think they've purchased over 50 million pounds in the last couple of years., So, you add this together and you get close to 140 million pounds that Cameco has been responsible for either taking off the market, putting into long-term contracts or leaving the ground. And so, we think we've done a fair bit of the heavy lifting and we're prepared to do more to improve. We have been there -- we think disciplined on our sales. We haven't been dumping material at the market and buying and putting into long-term contracts and we're patient., We're patients, you've heard us say we've got a pipeline with some of our bigger customers off market mostly where the big ones are coming back and saying, we're looking into the 2020s and it gets a little shaky about mid-decade as to where the [Indiscernible] Rangers are going off. And the great comment that's going on at the Olympic dam is not going to stand anytime soon. It could take you right to the end of the decade. You've got 18 million pounds a Cigar that would -- that was the end of the decade., And so, you could make an argument that somebody should be investing now because it takes us forever to get new ones on, but there's no market for it. And so that's the kind of the dilemma we're in right now. And so we're working through that. We had some, when talking about this off market deals, we have history with that, we have history -- I was there in 2010 in Ottawa signed with the Chinese $15 million there in Ottawa, in 2015 with Prime Minister, Modi in Harper, where we signed another big deal with the Indians. And then Navistar 2018 another base, so these are big chunky deals we call them agreements that take a long time to put in place, but when they do, they run for 5, 10, 15 years. So we're working on some of those., Financial side, I'll just say this about their finances were in good shape. The balance sheet strong credit, our team for keeping this company in very strong shape, be able to self manage, you will see run on the debt market. And not long ago, we refinanced for debt to those who do not even the next year, but in 2022. We still have very good favorable rates. And we reset that maturity to 2027 at 103% coupon rate, which we thought was very helpful for the Company. And so, we're good, we're good in that respect as well, company is strong., And the last point I'll say, and I'll turn it over to Andrews on the ESG front. Very important now we spend lots of time with our shareholders and now on ESG, and how we're doing on the sustainability front. And I would just say that's in our DNA, at Cameco has been for many years. We've always put the emphasis on people on indigenous communities on the environment, and the fact that our product produces no greenhouse gas, when it's used in react fugit that., So we're optimistic -- it's tough, it's tough every day, you have to be cheerleader for several people every day instead of going but company's strong. And I like how the industry is shaping up for us and I think there's some really good days to come., So, Andrew, I stop there, and then turn it back over you., Question-and-Answer Session"

Everyone, thanks again for joining us for our 2020 Stifel Healthcare Conference. We're on to our second fireside discussion of the day. Joining me for this panel, this discussion is John Thero, CEO of Amarin Corporation. John, thanks for joining us., John Thero, Derek, thanks for having me. And welcome everybody else who's on line here. I appreciate your interest. I probably should just get this out of the way. I anticipate, Derek, you're going to ask me some questions that may involve forward-looking statements. And anybody considering investing in Amarin should acknowledge that there are risks and uncertainties associated forward-looking statements, and review our SEC filings for discussions of those risks, so. But, hi, everybody., Derek Archila, Maybe to start, John, if you want to just kind of give us a brief background of where you guys are at and what you're doing, before we start diving into the Q&A., John Thero, Sure. So, that's pretty broad question. This weekend has been a very busy weekend. We've had at a number of different presentations of the annual scientific sessions of the American Heart Association. And as a company, AHA doesn't allow sort of outside discussion of that, but we will on Wednesday night be having a number of doctors together to discuss the eight different presentations that we've had there. Outside of that, sort of thinking about what we're doing -- and I guess, four different buckets. One is what are we doing to grow the United States, one of which is what we're doing to get approval and prepared in Europe, then what are we doing on rest of the world, and then what are we doing for other products beyond the VASCEPA, particularly after we get past the European approval. And each of those are fairly substantial topics. And while I could just keep living on each of them here, I suspect, Derek, you may have more specific questions that you want to ask on any one of those three. But, we are we are busy and active, and I think making progress., Question-and-Answer Session"

I am Chikashi Takeda, Chief Financial Officer at Olympus. I would like to thank you all for participating in this conference call for the consolidated financial results for the second quarter fiscal 2021. So I am going to ask you to follow the presentation materials, and I'm going to do the same myself. Please turn to Slide 3., First, I would like to explain the changes in our reporting structure. On September 30, Olympus signed a definitive agreement regarding the divestiture of the Imaging Business. Based on IFRS, the Imaging Business will be classified as a discontinued operation from this fiscal year. For that reason, today, I will focus on continuing operations excluding the discontinued operation. Please feel free to refer to the appendix, which includes information about the discontinued operation., Let me now provide an overview of our financial results. Please turn to Slide 4. This slide highlights our financial results for the second quarter fiscal 2021. Although consolidated revenue declined in the first half of the year due to COVID-19, in the second quarter, we saw a recovery trend and year-on-year decline in revenues slowed compared with the first quarter. Operating profit improved significantly, driven by improved revenue and also the lower SG&A expenses owing to activity constraints and strict cost control. The operating from margin was approximately 10% in the first half, improving to approximately 15% in the second quarter alone., Moving to 4-year forecast. We expect revenue to continue its gradual recovery towards the end of the fiscal year with an eventual annual decline of only approximately 8%. Operating profit is expected to reach about approximately ¥60 billion., Regarding SG&A expenses and investments, we are forecasting on the premise that business activities will become more active based on the ongoing recovery trend. Currently, COVID-19 is resurging mainly in Europe and the United States. So we will continue to monitor the situation., Depending on changes in the situation, we will further strengthen cost control and aim to achieve the 4-year forecast. In terms of the bottom line, although we expect to record a loss for the current fiscal year due in part to expenses related to divestiture of the Imaging business, in the interest of maintaining stable shareholder return, we expect an annual dividend of ¥10., I will now explain the consolidated financial results and provide a business review for the second quarter. Please turn to Slide 6. This is an overview of the consolidated financial results. First, I would like to explain the changes in the reporting structure in the profit and loss statement. As shown on the left side, revenue down to profit from continuing operations only list figures for continuing operation and excludes the discontinued operation. These changes have also been presented virtual actively for the results for FY 2020. Consolidated revenue in the first half amounted to the ¥316.5 billion, marking a decline due to COVID-19. After FX adjustment, the decline was 13%., In the middle of the presentation, we show our calculations on the impact. This is based on the assumption that we would have achieved the same level of performance as the previous year, if not for the COVID-19, excluding FX impact, other income and expenses and one-off item. Gross profit, ¥196 billion, and the cost ratio rose due mainly to a decline in factory operation owing to COVID-19, combined with ¥6.0 billion expenses recorded for the voluntary record of endoscopic products, which was disclosed in August., SG&A expenses totaled ¥161.5 billion. In addition to the strict controls we implemented, T&E, sales promotion and other expenses decreased because of inability to do normal activities owing to COVID-19., Operating profit, ¥30.3 billion. While this represents a decline, we managed to achieve an operating margin of approximately 10% in the first half amid a challenging business environment. Looking only at the second quarter, the operating margin was approximately 15%. Profit from continuing operation was ¥25.9 billion, a decline of ¥15.1 billion. Total losses for the first half, including both continuing and discontinued operations was ¥22.7 billion due mainly to a ¥47 billion losses recorded in connection with signing of the definitive agreement on the divestiture of the Imaging Business., Slide 7. The status of monthly revenue. This graph shows the revenue trend by division from January to September 2020, in comparison with previous years as a baseline at 100%. All divisions have continued to recover after hitting the bottom in May. Medical revenue recovered to the previous year's level in September. As for October, according to preliminary data for your reference, both Endoscopic Solutions division and Therapeutic Solutions division returned to growth year-on-year. Meanwhile, in the Scientific Solutions division, year-on-year decline in revenue shrank slightly., Please turn to Slide 8. Now we will go into details about each business segment. First, the Endoscopic Solutions division. Revenue, ¥182 billion, down 10%, excluding FX impact. In the first half, COVID-19 caused restrictions on business activities, such as sales, promotion and training as well as a decrease in the number of procedures and a reduced willingness to invest in CapEx in hospitals. However, year-on-year decline in revenue improved from the first to the second quarters. In particular, Europe grew 2% in the first half and 6% in the second quarter, excluding FX impact, driven by the U.K., where the government has been strengthening its health care system, and Eastern Europe, where we were able to win bids for some large projects., Operating profit was ¥42.1 billion due to SG&A streamlining. Despite recording costs for the voluntary recall of endoscopic products, and this resulted in an operating margin of 24.3%, excluding FX impact., Slide 9. Please turn to this page to see the results from the Therapeutic Solutions division. Revenue, ¥90.9 billion, down 15%, excluding the FX impact. In the first half, COVID-19 caused a decline in the number of procedures and restrictions on sales promotion activities. In response to a recovery in the number of procedures in the second quarter, year-on-year decline in revenue improved markedly from the first quarter to 6%. Performance was particularly strong in Europe, where the growth was 9% in the second quarter., Operating profit was ¥10.2 billion due to a smaller decline in revenue and cost reductions, resulting in an operating margin of 12.3%, excluding FX impact. The operating margin of the second quarter was 18%, excluding FX impact, exceeding the previous year's level., Slide 10. Please take a look at this page for the Scientific Solutions division's revenue, ¥40.3 billion, down 17% excluding FX. In China, sales of industrial microscopes increased, driven in part by demand for 5G-related electronic components and semiconductor markets, resulting in positive growth. However, total revenue declined due to COVID-19. Operating profit was ¥200 million due primarily to declined revenue. Operating margin in the second quarter saw a significant improvement, ending at 10%, excluding FX impact., Next slide, Slide 11. Here, you can see the financial position as of September 30, 2020. Please note that we distinguish line items regarding assets and liabilities for the discontinued operation. Namely assets held for sale and liabilities directly associated with assets held for sale. To ensure a stable business operation in light of the COVID-19 impact and enhanced liquidity in hand, we increased cash and deposits and bonds and loans payable. The equity ratio was 30.4%, down 6.1 percentage points from the end of previous fiscal year due to an increase in liabilities and loans of the first half or the loss of the first half., Slide 12, status of cash flows. Cash flow from operating activities decreased by ¥29.9 billion to ¥37.4 billion, against the backdrop of decline in operating profit, due to COVID-19. Cash flow from investing activities may appear to have decreased considerably but include time deposits of ¥40 billion. Purchase of property, plant and equipment and the capitalization of R&D expenditures both declined, leading to real fresh free cash flow of positive ¥7.2 billion. Cash flow from financing activities rose by ¥91.8 billion to ¥81.2 billion due to funds raised through long-term loans and corporate bonds. As a result, cash and cash equivalents as of September 30 stood at ¥210.5 billion., Next, forecast for the full year fiscal 2021. Please turn to Slide 14, our forecast for the full year. The exchange rates assumed for the forecasts in light of the recent trends in foreign exchange market are ¥106 to the U.S. dollar and ¥122 to the euro. The COVID-19 impact is expected to continue to improve gradually toward the end of the fiscal year. And we forecast that year-on-year decline in revenue for the full year will be limited to approximately 8%. We expect S&G expenses to decrease year-on-year. But looking only at the second half, the expenses are expected to rise. Remote activities and work from home have been established amid continued restrictions on business activities and we will continue to strengthen control of SG&A expenses. However, we assume that activities will become more active in the second half and beyond. In addition, we expect expenses for strengthening our IT infrastructure and QA RA functions in the second half, as well as reduced capitalization of R&D expenditures compared to the previous year. As a result, operating profit is expected to reach approximately ¥60 billion with operating margin of approximately 9%., Total loss of ¥5.5 billion is expected due to the loss associated with the divestiture of the Imaging Business. Despite these difficult forecasts, we expect year-end dividends for fiscal 2021 to be ¥10 per share unchanged from the previous year from the viewpoint of maintaining stable dividends. While we have prepared these forecasts based on circumstances as they stand now, as COVID-19 infections are on the rise, particularly in Europe and the U.S., outlook remains uncertain. We will continue to monitor the COVID-19 impact closely and make appropriate course corrections so that we can respond to changes as they arise., Please turn to Slide 15 for our forecast by business segment. Despite some regional differences, the number of procedures is on a recovery trend in both ESD and TSD, and we expect revenue to decrease approximately 7% for the full year. We expect active operating -- we expect to achieve operating margins of approximately 22% and 11% in ESD and TSD, respectively. With regard to SSD, although we expect business activities to gradually recover from the second half, we believe the recovery will lag behind the Medical Business. For the full year, both revenue and profit will decline, but we still expect to remain in the black., In terms of elimination and corporate, we expect to incur costs to strengthen IT infrastructure and enhance QA/RA functions in the second half and currently forecast around the same level as in the previous year., Lastly, some highlights of the initiatives we are pursuing to transform Olympus into a truly global tech company. Slide 17. In the first half of the year, we steadily implemented corporate reform initiatives. We will continue to move forward with these corporate reform efforts in the second half with executive officers taking a leading role., On the following slides, I will explain our progress in the second quarter. Slide 18. We launched ENDO-AID, an endoscopic CAD platform powered by artificial intelligence that can be equipped in our EVIS X1 next-generation endoscopy system in Europe and some parts of Asia in early November. The platform enables real-time display of automatically detected suspicious regions such as polyps and cancers. This aids in the discovery of lesions and contributes to enhanced quality in endoscopic diagnosis. It is expected to further strengthen our leadership in the GI endoscopy system with over 70% market share by enhancing added value of EVIS X1., Slide 19. We have made progress with 2 initiatives aimed at achieving sustainable growth in the medical business. First, we acquired FH Ortho, a medical device manufacturer in the field of orthopedics. In addition to expanding our product portfolio in this field, the acquisition is aimed at stimulating business growth by distributing our current products via FH ORTHO's existing global distribution channels. We have also developed the first ultrasound device indicated for arthroscopic surgery. Combined with the portfolio gained through this acquisition, we are now better positioned to provide products and solutions in the field of orthopedic minimally invasive surgery., Next, as disclosed today, we started deliberation on reorganizing Olympus Group's sales functions in Japan. To realize sustainable business growth, the reform of our sales distribution structures has become a pressing issue. Moving forward, we aim to reinforce our sales capabilities through flexible rescores assignments and retention of highly capable talent by integrating the domestic sales functions of Olympus Corporation and Olympus Medical Science Sales Corporation for Medical and Scientific Solutions businesses., Slide 20. Starting with this briefing, we will disclose key product catalysts that will drive our future growth in the medical field. First, ESD. This year, we launched the long-awaited EVIS X1 next-generation GI endoscopy system in Europe and some parts of Asia, and an endoscopic CAD platform that can be combined with it in Europe and some parts of Asia. These new products are expected to drive our future growth. Looking further ahead, we are aiming for greater growth with launches in the U.S., the world's largest market and in fast-growing Chinese market., In the U.S., it has been proposed that the recommended age for colonoscopies be lowered to 45, and we believe this will provide a tailwind for Olympus. In the area of surgical endoscopy system, we will launch our flagship VISERA ELITE II endoscopy system in the fast-growing Chinese market. Additionally, with an eye on sustained growth, we are developing a next-generation surgical endoscopy system that is expected to become one of our future growth drivers., Slide 21, TSD. Various therapeutic devices, including ERCP and ESD-related products have contributed to revenue. In the future, we plan to introduce single-use endoscopes as announced in our corporate strategy. Adding single-use endoscopes to our lineup will enable us to build an outstanding product portfolio catering to every scenario in endoscopic medicine and to further bolster our competitive advantages. In the GI endotherapy area, we will continue to expand our lineup in the existing product area to achieve business growth. In the urology area, we are introducing strategic products in keeping with the corporate strategy. Both iTind and SOLTIVE SuperPulsed Laser System are equipped with innovative technologies and have strong growth potential., Additionally, as announced in a recent news release, we have developed protective equipment for endoscopic examinations designed to reduce risks of COVID-19 and other infections. We believe this solution will provide an environment, enable linked medical professionals to carry out endoscopic examination and treatment safely, and will help create an environment in which patients can undergo procedures with peace of mind. Moving forward, we will continue to develop products that provide solutions to address unmet medical needs., Thank you for your attention. Now let us have questions and answers session., Question-and-Answer Session"

As Corona pandemic continues to occupy us and in light of the growing number of infection cases, uncertainty about the further development of the crisis is increasing, we have come through the pandemic relatively well in Germany so far, but the situation is unchanged areas., However, both the residential segment and we as a company so far have still only marginally affected by the crisis. Compared to the publication of our half year results, the number of tenants who contacted us in connection with payment difficulties due to the corona pandemic has increased only slightly. Furthermore, we continue to have the situation in our nursing homes under control., Belong to all of us, here the economic effects caused by the crisis depends on how long it will last. So far, only a fraction of our 30% corona relief fund has been used. We are therefore well prepared for the situation getting gross. We will take individual cases of hardship into account and assume responsibility for our tenants. Despite the uncertainties due to corona, we can look back with great pride on what we have already achieved this year., We have significantly expanded our involvement in new construction by acquiring and anticipating in project development platforms. We continue by our portfolio in a way, which significantly improved its quality. And despite the difficult environment on the capital markets, we were able to successfully place two bonds to address our upcoming maturities until 2023. We have not left into crisis mode, but have actively set the course for a successful future for Deutsche Wohnen., Everything we do is dominated by conviction that quality makes the difference. So, we believe in our long-term market strategy, we investing year-by-year, a lot of money for to improve the quality of our housing stock. Today, we have the most attractive most energy efficient housing offer compared to the competition. Our tenants' customers and partners benefit from a good offer that remains affordable. 9 out from 10 tenants already gives us good marks for our range of apartments and our service., So, I'm very optimistic about the future prospects. Our sector, and especially our company, as a recently published survey of Price Waterhouse, and Urban Land Institute shows investors are favoring markets that offer defensive low risk characteristics. And the safe haven markets are mainly located in Germany, with Berlin taking once again the top of the city rankings. The fact that the residential sector is benefiting from the uncertainties caused by the corona pandemic is also demonstrated by development on the transaction market, which Phillip will discuss in detail in a moment., But let me say briefly that there is still an incredible amount of liquidity in the market and transactions are being executed at record prices. We will continue to deal with the macroeconomic appeals and related issues for a long time. Our sector will benefit from this in the long-term. Pressure of demand will continue for yields housing rolls in my view continue to become more expenses., Against this background, the valuation of our portfolio seems to me very cheap. As you can see on Page 4 of the presentation, in the third quarter, we have been working very intensively on the biggest challenge facing our industry, achieving our climate targets. We presented our concept for socially responsible climate protection at the hybrid event in Berlin and discussed with experts from fine politics business., To achieve an almost climate neutral folding stock by 2050, the rate of refurbishment must be. But this can only succeed if the state landlords and tenants pull together. However, the letter often rejects energy efficient renovations, because they fear rent increases. We therefore propose that tenants the relief partly of the burden of the modernization shots. The money for this should come from funds from the Energy and Climate Fund, which brought from the CO2 pricing for among other things heating will flow., In addition to the necessary renovations, however, we must also make full use of the technological possibilities for CO2 reduction and offer our tenants the opportunity is less sustainable. This is why we have agreed to cooperate with GETEC in the field of green power generation and electromobility and will install thousand new photovoltaic systems and 2000 charging points in our Berlin neighborhood., This is the next step towards climate neutral living and working. We will invest around €75 million here over the next 10 years. Only if we tackle this challenge together and above all in a timely manner, we will be able to achieve our ambitious goals, want to and we will our contribution to this., And with that I hand you over to Philip., Philip Grosse, Yes. Thank you, Michael and a warm welcome to our earnings call also from my side. And all-in-all, the first nine months of 2020 have been very successful and the numbers contain little surprises in my view., So let's start with Page 5, the portfolio overview. As you can see, the monthly average in place rent of our portfolio is broadly stable compared to year-end 2019. And as mentioned in our last earnings call, this development is because of the Berlin rent freeze law, which continues to have a negative impact on the rent development of our Berlin stock for the time being., As discussed previously, we have structured our rental contract and that's pretty much in line with most market participants. It's such that you can retro actively charge the higher rent according to the civil code, once our highest court has concerned the unconstitutionality of the Berlin rent freeze law. The possibility of claiming that's a difference has been concerned just recently then the constitutional court dismissed emergency appeal on the lowering of rents that will come through from the end of November onwards., Our relating rents based on the civil code are stable compared to the levels of last year, so slightly north of €9 per square meter per month. If you have not revalued our portfolio, as of the end of September, the average value per square meter remained almost unchanged at around €2,400 per square meter translating into a gross yield of 3.4%., On the next page, we will have a closer look at the development of the Berlin residential markets. As you can see, since the implementation of the Berlin rent freeze law, the number of rental offers declined significantly by almost 40%, if demand for rental apartments remains very high, it is more difficult than ever for tenants to find a new apartment. This was the predominant driver for prices for condominiums, with almost €5,000 per square meter, an impressive increase of another 7% year-on-year driven by further good compression., The transaction market for multifamily homes remains active, we have observed the stable pricing environment, that average price is north of €3,000 per square meter. After having started the year-end valuation process for our portfolio, considering market evidence and following discussions with our appraiser, Jones Lang LaSalle, we see a very comfortable to guide for a valuation uplift of around 6% at year-end that is excluding capitalized investments., This is predominantly driven by an increase once again of the value of our Berlin stock round €2,800 per square meter. And further to add with a final ruling of our supreme court which we expect next year, there will be a further positive stimulus for the Berlin transaction market., On Page 7, some quick remarks on our like-for-like rent development which is obviously distorted and will be distorted for as long as the Berlin rent freeze law is in place. Consequently, like-for-like rental growth has come down to 0.9% for the total portfolio. Adjusted for the negative impact of the rent freeze law like-for-like rental growth would have been around 2.4% for the entire portfolio when 6% for Berlin., So far catch up potential in case the Berlin rent freeze law is ruled unconstitutional amounts to around €5 million. It's the Berlin rent keep law is forcing landlords to reduce some rents for existing tenants starting November 23. This year, we will see a third drop around 6% in Q4 on the rent per square meter basis for our Berlin stock market., As you can see on Page 8, the lifting business is running very stable. Income from rents increased by 2% year on year to around €634 million, NOI came out at €514 billion so slightly above last year's level. NOI margin of 81% slightly declined by one percentage point compared to last year, adjusted for maintenance the NOI margin remained broadly stable, despite the current regulatory pressure on the top-line growth., Moving to Page 9. Our disposal business, no big change here. Our prioritization business continues to deliver average gross margins of around 30%. For the institutional disposal business, the gross margin is at 15% for the first nine months of 2020. And this as previously explained, is to a large extent driven by clean up disposes of 13 nursing facilities, its book value., Please keep in mind that the only reflect transactions which had already transferred title in that overview, which is why the time disposals of around 2400 units are not yet included. performer for these disposals our gross margin was significantly improved to around 30% for the full year of 2020., Let's moved to our nursing assisted living business on Page 10. Despite the challenging environment that regards to the pandemic, our nursing business continues to perform as solid as before. Increased spending for safety and hygiene measures have been fully compensated by Long Term Care Insurance. Both EBITDA contributions are slightly down by 5%, which is due to the mentioned cleanup disposal in May this year. Annual rent associated with the sold assets is around €12 million per year. So part of that in the numbers we have shown on the page., Moving to Page 11.You can see our adjusted EBITDA excluding disposals, which amounted to €547 million with an attractive EBITDAR margin of around 80% proving once again the efficiency of our business model. The one-off mainly transaction related the biggest part of €20 million is from real estate transfer tax in relation to the ISARIA transaction. We have slightly adjusted the definition of our cost ratio, which is now in addition to the rental income, also accounting for the lease revenues from our nursing business in the numerator, and came out at around 11%., The slight increase in our cost ratio is partially driven by the provisioning for the long-term incentive component of our compensation due to relative outperformance of our shares. And just as a reminder, the negative contribution from our disposal business is because it excludes €47 million book gains, which have already been accounted for as disposed of related valuation gains of our investment properties. So by that you can see that remains a highly profitable business., One Page 12, you can see that we are straight on the way to reach our FFO I guidance. FFO I amounted €422 million and €1.21 on a per share basis. So comparable to last year, the increased importance of our development business, we decided to make use of the accounting option to capitalize interest expenses for our developed towed projects. By that, we make sure that FFO I episode one is not distorted during the period of construction. The amount of capitalized interest by the way was around €6 million for the nine months., Page 13, EPRA NAV came out at €47.89 and 2% higher than year-end. Moving to Page 14, our traditional slide on capital structure, broadly unchanged. Average interest rates at 1.2%, average maturity, seven years, first bigger upcoming maturities in 2023. The LTV came out just try off 41%, however, pro forma or the cash proceeds from the signed, but most yet close disposal as well as the expected year end valuation uplift. However, our LTV will come out at the relative midpoint of our 35 to 40 target range., Last on Page 15, outlook confirm our 2020 guidance as it relates to FFO I to comparable to last year, and further as already mentioned, 6% valuation uplift at year end, positively impacting at per EPRA NAV per share, which would come out at the 20% 20% premium versus our., Next, I conclude the presentation and hand it back to the operator to open the floor for Q&A., Question-and-Answer Session"

We're just going to wait two or three seconds, make sure everything is clicking in. And so, good afternoon everybody, and thank you for joining us for the Fourth Annual IO Summit that annually coincides with the Citi Conference. I'm Yaron Werber analyst here at Cowen. And it's a great pleasure to moderate the session today with Regeneron and the team here really needs no introduction., We have with us today Israel Lowy, who is the Senior Vice President, Translational Science and Oncology; and also Andres Sirulnik, who is the Senior Vice President for Translational and Clinical Sciences, Hematology. And everybody, of course, knows Justin Holko, VP of IR., So we're going to pass it on to Justin to give the quick forward-looking statements and he's going to make some opening remarks. If you want to ask any questions, just look below the webcast window. There's a little box there, you can come punch in your question and we'll be happy to read it for you., So, Justin, over to you., Justin Holko, Thanks, Yaron, and thanks for the opportunity to be with you today. There's a lot of things going on at Regeneron that get a lot of attention, but happy to talk about oncology today is an area that we're very excited about, both near-term and longer term., Before we begin, I would like to remind you that remarks made on today's webcast do include forward-looking statements by Regeneron, including those relating to, in particular, oncology. In this case, every forward-looking statement is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause results to differ materially., With that said, Izzy, do you want to take us through a brief introduction?, Israel Lowy, Sure. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you also for the opportunity to present. So just to set the stage for the actual questions that I think people -- you would like to get some details on. I'd just like to step back and just refresh the audience's understanding of where -- how we are approaching oncology., And over the last nearly 10 years, we have made the decision that this is a long-haul kind of effort that at the core of the effort is the ability to bring combination therapies into immunotherapy. And that we made a commitment to use our significant, we think, best-in-industry antibody making prowess to come with a suite of agents that would afford us combinatorial flexibility to bring to bear potent combinations to treat tumors using the immune system., And as a foundation for that, we decided we needed our own anti-PD-1 to support this. I think what we've done with that is to demonstrate over the data that has come out over the last couple of years that we have indeed succeeded in making an antibody that stands up to anyone else in the class. And that will serve and is serving as a first foundation., And where we've moved from that is to generate now a series of new bispecific antibodies, both CD3 targeting, costimulatory targeting that affords us the opportunity to make progress of this. What we're not going to talk about today is new things that are in our lab that will, I think, afford us even more combinatory or flexibility in the years to come. And of course, one of the really nice things about our success has been, we've been excited to get interest from partners that have complementary technologies that we can synergize with also., So I don't know I have fortunate now to have a colleague, Andre Sirulnik, who is taking on the focus of the hematologic malignancies as well as non-malignant hematology. And so our leading bispecifics are actually in that space., Question-and-Answer Session"

My name is Andrzej Matyczynski, and I’m Reading’s Executive Vice President of Global Operations. With me, as usual, are Ellen Cotter, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Gilbert Avanes, our Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer., Before we begin the substance of the call, I will just run through the usual caveats. In accordance with the safe harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, certain matters that will be addressed in this earnings call may constitute forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual performance to be materially different from the performance indicated or implied by such statements. Such risk factors are clearly set out in our SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements., In addition, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures on this call. Reconciliations and definitions of non-GAAP financial measures, which are segment operating income, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, are included in our recently issued 2020 third quarter earnings release on the company’s website. We have adjusted, where applicable, the EBITDA items we believe to be external to our business and not reflective of our cost of doing business or results of operations. Such costs include legal expenses relating to extraordinary litigation and any other items that can be considered nonrecurring in accordance with the two year SEC requirement for determining an item is nonrecurring, infrequent or unusual in nature., We believe adjusted EBITDA is an important supplemental measure of our performance. In today’s call, we also use an industry accepted financial measure called theater-level cash flow, which is theater-level revenue less direct theater-level expenses; and property-level cash flow, which is property-level revenue less direct property-level expenses. Please note that our comments are necessarily summary in nature, and anything we say is qualified by the more detailed disclosure set forth in our Form 10-Q and other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission., So with that behind us, I’ll turn it over to Ellen, who will review the results for the third quarter 2020 and discuss in more detail Reading’s strategies in navigating the COVID-19 pandemic and taking Reading through to the post-COVID era, followed by Gilbert, who will provide a more detailed financial review. Ellen?, Ellen Cotter, Thanks, Andrzej. Thank you, everyone, for joining our call today. I’d like to start by saying that all of us at Reading International hope that you, your family and your friends remain healthy amid the continuing challenges with COVID-19. The COVID-19 crisis and its wide-ranging implications significantly affected our third quarter results. Governments have forced cinema closures, causing major studios to postpone their movies or move them off the theatrical release schedule and go directly to online platforms. Where we have been permitted to reopen, we are typically being required to operate with government-imposed seat capacity restrictions and in some cases, have not been able to sell food and beverages., At $10.2 million, our Q3 2020 consolidated total revenues represented a significant decrease versus Q3 in 2019. This depressed level of revenues resulted in a segment operating loss of $14.3 million, negative EBITDA of $11.7 million and a net loss of $19.2 million. Needless to say, it’s been a very difficult operating environment for us. But to date, our company has weathered the storm, and we anticipate that it will continue to do so. This is the product of: one, our long-term diversified business plan, which features two businesses: our real estate and cinema operations in three countries that have had differing approaches and exposure to the COVID-19 crisis; and two, the steps we began implementing early on to cut operating costs to defer or abate rents and to defer capital improvements., Yesterday, the governments of Australia and New Zealand reported 0 new cases of COVID-19 through community transmission. The United States has had less success but our economy and people are resilient, and we believe that the current disruptions to our U.S. cinema business are more in the nature of a hiatus as opposed to a final curtain., While about 91% of our revenues today come from the cinema business, between operating and development properties we have over 12.8 million square feet of real estate in the United States, Australia and New Zealand, which are reflected in our September 30, 2020 balance sheet showing total assets of $673.4 million. At the end of the third quarter, we did a complete asset impairment analysis and determined that no reductions in the carrying values of our assets were required., And while our cinema business and the industry today is facing very challenging times, I’m confident that the cinema industry will get to the other side of COVID-19. We see encouraging cinema attendance trends in Australia and New Zealand, even without a regular diet of tentpole films. We read about the success of the movie theaters in countries like China and Japan, where cinemas have been allowed to reopen, and they have a strong local film offering. The private screening program that we launched in our theaters in Q2 2020 has demonstrated that moviegoers are happy to pay a premium to go to the theater, albeit right now with smaller groups., And the film companies, big and small, have reaffirmed their commitment to the theatrical experience. They’re committed to putting movies back into theaters because it makes economic sense for them to do so. According to what we hear, releasing films direct to streaming does not generate the revenues that would have been realized had one employed the traditional cinema-first release pattern., Now I’ll give a quick overview of our dual businesses for Q3 2020. At September 30, 2020, 63% of our global theaters were trading, some with social distancing, some with food and beverage sales restrictions and all bearing the increased costs required to generate customer confidence in a COVID-19 operating environment that demands robust cleaning and safety protocols., During the third quarter, only two movies from the major studios opened in the U.S. and three opened in Australia and New Zealand. Despite this lack of film, we were encouraged by the cinema results in Australia and New Zealand, where COVID has largely been contained. Taking into account rent relief and government labor subsidies on a theater-level cash flow basis, our Australian circuit generated an acceptable positive cash flow for the quarter., Regarding our real estate operations, our three live theaters in New York City and Chicago remain closed by government mandate. And 94% of our third-party lease tenants in our Australian real estate portfolio are open and trading and only 15% of those tenants remained in existing occupancy abatement or deferral arrangements as a result of COVID., Through the quarter, we continue to proactively monitor our liquidity with a laser focus on cash management. Gilbert will go into this in greater detail in a few minutes. But let me mention a few key points. As of September 30, 2020, our consolidated cash position was $27.8 million. As you know at the end of March 2020, we drew down on all our credit lines and continued to maintain those borrowing levels through Q2., In Q3, in an effort to reduce our interest expense, we paid down $5.8 million on our Bank of America revolving credit facility. As of September 30, our overall bank debt was $274.1 million. We’ve obtained loan modifications from Bank of America, National Australian Bank and Westpac. We’re currently in compliance with our loan covenants and have obtained waivers where necessary. We continued to defer all our major CapEx projects, except for completing the 44 Union Square construction and providing the required tenant improvements for our new full floor tenant at our Culver City building., During Q3, we filed for tax refunds in the U.S. associated with benefits provided by the Cares Act, amounting to about $5.1 million. During Q3, we had filed for a tax refund in Australia equal to A$1.5 million, which we received in October 2020. Our management team continued to spend significant time renegotiating our 45 cinema leases with third-party landlords to abate or defer occupancy costs., Executing on our three-year strategic plans, since we’re at the end of the 44 Union Square construction, we’re in the process of refinancing our construction loan on that property. Based on the value that we created by completing the construction of that project in New York City, we believe we can take out our construction debt and put a mortgage on the property. We’re also reviewing certain unencumbered noncore real estate assets for potential sale or financing opportunities., Generally speaking, we believe we entered the COVID-19 period better prepared for a shock to the system than some of our cinema peers. While we have reviewed a number of cinema acquisition opportunities in the U.S. over the years, we declined to pay the high multiples being demanded by such assets and focused on improving our existing operations in the U.S., Australia and New Zealand and expanding our operations and building our pipeline of cinema projects in Australia and New Zealand., We mainly paid for these cinema enhancements from our cash flow rather than taking on large amounts of debt. Our business plan paid off, as Australia and New Zealand have been less impacted than the U.S. and almost all of our cinemas are now open for business in those two countries., Likewise, we’ve focused on our real estate acquisition activities in Australia. Over the past five years, we acquired Cannon Park in Townsville, the Telstra building on the Auburn Redyard property and the office building adjacent to Newmarket Village. In the U.S., we have deferred or passed upon other potential projects to focus on Tammany Hall., We consider Tammany Hall to be a long-term asset in one of the best locations in the United States. With only $40 million in debt, this asset represents a substantial capital reserve for our company. We’ve been careful not to bite off more than we can chew to finance cinema improvements out of our cash flow, and to preserve our borrowing capacity for challenging situations such as the one in which we currently find ourselves., Now let’s turn to a review of each business, beginning with our global cinema business. I’ll focus on where we are today and what the short-term future holds. Our Q3 2020 global cinema total revenues were $7.3 million, up from only $1.2 million in Q2. Each of our countries experienced a significant uptick in revenues, Q2 versus Q3, despite the fact that many theaters remain closed and operating with restrictions in place., Let’s start with Australia and New Zealand, two countries that have comparatively fared very well during the COVID-19 crisis. By July 1, 2020, all of our 23 Australian theaters had reopened with social distancing measures in place. However, on July 8, 2020, we had to close six of our seven theaters in the state of Victoria due to a spike in new COVID-19 cases as the local government ordered a six-week closure., On August 5, 2020, the seventh cinema had to be closed as the state announced a full lockdown due to a second wave of COVID-19 in Victoria. These theaters in Victoria have historically represented, on average, about 30% of our Australian cinema box office. So this has negatively impacted our overall total revenues. We just recently heard that the state of Victoria has cleared movie theaters to open. Today, Reading reopened six of its seven theaters in Victoria with social distancing restrictions in place., Today, our theaters that are operating have physical distancing measures in place. Generally, our TITAN premium and Gold Lounge auditoriums, where we offer recliner seating, can operate at about 60% of the seating capacity. And the other non-reclining auditoriums can operate at about 30% capacity. And since reopening, we’ve been operating with strict cleaning and sanitization protocols in place., In New Zealand, through Q3 and today, nine of our 10 cinemas are operating. Unfortunately, our top-performing and historically profitable Reading Cinema at Courtenay Central in Wellington remain closed during the third quarter of 2020, as it has been since the beginning of 2019 due to seismic concerns., Since reopening in New Zealand, we’ve been operating with strict cleaning and sanitization protocols in line with government and health department regulations. At the end of August, governmentally-imposed physical distancing requirements were discontinued, and our theaters there are now operating without any physical distancing measures in place, so all seats are available for sale., Since reopening our cinemas in Australia and New Zealand, we’ve also been operating with a reduced show time schedule. Once the COVID-19 issues are behind us and new films start to be released, we’ll resume a typical daily show schedule where we typically offer five to six shows per day. During Q3, Tenet was the highest grossing film in Australia and New Zealand., And Trolls World Tour, which opened in New Zealand in Q2, followed in second place. Note also that Tenet had not opened in Victoria because of the lockdown. So we expect this Christopher Nolan movie to perform quite well in the six of our seven Victorian theaters reopening as of today. These are the only two tentpole films from major studios that opened during this period of time., During this time, our circuit has also relied on locally produced films. For instance, Savage, a local New Zealand film, performed really well for our New Zealand circuit. The recently opened Rams, starring local favorite Sam Neill, has also been a nice box office earner. Also in Australia and New Zealand, we’ve been able to enjoy the release of certain strong independent movies that did not have the benefit of a fully supported theatrical run in the U.S. For instance, After We Collided performed quite well in Australia., In Q3, with all of our New Zealand cinemas reopened except for Courtenay Central, our attendance represented 28% of the attendance in Q3 2019. In Australia, with our seven theaters in Victoria being closed for almost all of Q3 and with almost no support from major studio tentpole films, our attendance was over 15% of Q3 in 2019. And reaffirming our confidence in the movie-going experience, in Australia, even with seven of our theaters still shut on a year-to-date basis, we set a record for highest box office per capita., Our cinemas in the United States have endured a much more challenged COVID trajectory. The varying COVID-19 case numbers and governmental approaches have required us to develop multiple strategies tailored to specific localities. We’ve had to react differently in the state of Hawaii than we have in New Jersey or in the various counties in California. During Q3 2020, 13 of our 24 U.S. movie theaters were reopened at some point during the quarter, leaving 11 cinemas closed. The 11 that were closed include three of our theaters in New York City, including the Angelika New York, which is one of our top grossing and top cash flowing theaters., Through the quarter, we saw some theaters open and then close again due to spikes in COVID-19 cases. For example, in late August, the Governor of Hawaii lifted the stay-at-home order and we began to reopen some of our theaters on Oahu. But then just days later, we had to shut down again due to a rise in COVID cases. And when we reopened in late September, we were not permitted to sell food and beverages., As of today, we expect the following for the next few weeks or maybe months. Our San Diego theaters and the Tower Theater in Sacramento will close again this week for at least three weeks. Six theaters, including our New York City theaters, will remain closed due to government mandate. Nine theaters are expected to stay open, and we’ll keep some of our theaters closed due to cash flow priorities., All of our reopened U.S. theaters are operating with social distancing restrictions in place and cleaning and sanitization protocols. Other health and safety protocols include the requirement that masks must be worn by guests and staff, contactless transactions, hand sanitizer stations throughout the premises, updated HVAC filters and increased sanitizations at high-touch point areas., During Q3, Tenet and New Mutants were the only movies released for major studios. The lack of new and compelling film has been a fundamental problem for our reopened theaters in the U.S. With respect to our global cinema business during the third quarter, there are a few recurring themes. On a positive note, our F&B per caps in all three countries set records for the highest third quarter and year-to-date., During the third quarter, our management teams continued to proactively monitor our cinema cash burn across all three countries. We were active in applying for government subsidies available in Australia and New Zealand. In Australia, the government-sponsored JobKeeper program allowed us to retain most of our employees on an economic basis. It was recently announced that the JobKeeper subsidy program has been extended through the end of March 2021 under a reduced rate scheme., Since the COVID-19 crisis began, we’ve been reimbursed for approximately AUD 10.9 million of our labor costs through the end of September 2020. In New Zealand, the wage subsidy program ended in August 2020. Since the COVID-19 crisis began, we’ve received close to NZD 2 million in subsidies. With occupancy costs being our primary fixed costs, one of our main priorities has been our cinema leases. We’ve negotiated reduced rent deals with virtually all of our 45 third-party landlords, and in some cases, we’re able to negotiate further extensions., Today, we’re not in default of any of our leases. By the end of the third quarter, our global cinemas had deferred rent of approximately $11 million. On a global basis, our repayment terms range from 12 months to 36 months. It’s worth a reminder that the rent expense shown on the income statement represents our full rent obligation for the quarter reduced by any abatements received. Because the U.S. has been particularly hard hit, we have aggressively renewed our conversations with all third-party landlords about occupancy relief., Notwithstanding these challenging circumstances, we believe our relationship with our landlords to be good. To date, almost all of our landlords have been willing to work with us to one extent or another. In implementing stringent liquidity management practices, we’ve delayed all non-essential capital projects to the extent practical. We’ll readdress our renovation pipeline when our liquidity management practices dictate. The renovation of our Consolidated Theaters at the Kahala Mall in Honolulu continues to be on hold. When completed, all eight auditoriums will have recliner seating and will be offering an elevated F&B menu. We’re closely monitoring this situation and expect to resume construction when it’s feasible., As previously announced, we have four cinemas under agreements to lease in Australia. However, due to COVID-19, we’ve been proactive with our landlords as to what the next steps might be and when. We’re proceeding with the fit-out of a newly constructed Reading Cinemas in Jindalee in Queensland and anticipate the launch of that new cinema by the end of 2020. We expect to open our new cinema in Altona in Victoria in 2021 and South City Square in Queensland in 2022. We’re working with our landlord in Traralgon in Victoria to find a workable solution to our current situation., During the third quarter, our management continued to work on and progress certain revenue efforts that were borne out of the COVID-19 crisis. While these new initiatives might not be generating significant revenue today, we expect that over time, they’ll enhance our overall profitability when we return to normal operating levels. We continued expanding our private screening program launched in Q2 2020 in Australia, New Zealand and in Hawaii. Today, all of our opened theaters are offering private screenings to our guests., We continued our cinema ease-at-home program, where our guests can enhance their at-home movie experience with select menu favorites from our kitchens. We’ve been taking orders curbside and via the Uber Eats app. We continue to participate in virtual cinema screening programs arranged with certain specialty distributors, and throughout the quarter, we’ve continued to work towards the launch of our own streaming platform, to be called Angelika Anywhere, which we expect to launch in Q4 2020., Wrapping up our review of the global cinema business. We’ve clearly been disappointed with recent decisions by certain studios to release their movies straight to streaming or PVOD. However, we put ourselves in the shoes of those decision-makers and take into account the extraordinary circumstances we’re living through, and you understand their predicament. This has been a terrible time for both distributors and exhibitors. Everyone’s trying to keep their heads above water and manage the liquidity crisis that most did not expect going into 2020., In our conversations with film companies, their commitment to the theatrical window when things normalize is there. Most movie release dates impacted by COVID-19 have resulted in those major titles being rescheduled into 2021 and beyond as opposed to releasing them directly to a streaming service. And it’s worth noting again, our understanding from most major film companies, once COVID-19 is under control, bypassing the theatrical window and going straight to streaming will not be in their economic best interest., Right now, the 2021 release schedule looks crowded but exciting. Just the first two quarters of 2021 look great. Disney’s animated Raya and the Last Dragon is now the de facto first tentpole film of 2021, scheduled for March 12, 2021. The Bond film, No Time To Die is slated to open on April 2, followed by A Quiet Place Part II on April 23 and Black Widow on May 7. One of our stockholders asked us to comment further about the future release schedule for the specialty theaters. Today, 2021 is on track to be a year with a solid number of quality art house films. At this time, there are only a few big art house films with release dates, but we expect this to change quickly when New York and L.A. are cleared to reopen theaters., Noteworthy titles today with a release date include Nomadland, starring Frances McDormand, currently scheduled for December 4, 2020. If that date sticks, the film would extend well into Q1 2021 because it’s got lots of Oscar buzz. Truffle Hunters and The Father, two pictures with Oscar buzz from Sony Pictures Classics, are scheduled today to open at the end of December 2020. French Exit by indie director Azazel Jacobs, starring Michelle Pfeiffer, Lucas Hedges and Tracy Letts, is dated on February 12, 2021. The United States vs. Billie Holiday, from acclaimed director Lee Daniels, is dated on February 21, 2021. Antlers, from director Scott Cooper and producer Guillermo del Toro, is scheduled for April 17, 2021. Also looking ahead, because of COVID-19, the biggest art house films did not premiere film festivals in 2020 and were held by sales agents to premier in 2021 at Berlin, Cannes, Venice and Toronto. So following these premieres, we expect more solid titles into late 2021 and 2022., Now turning to our global real estate business. Reflecting the strength of our dual and diversified business plan, our real estate business was much less impacted by COVID-19 than our cinema business. In Q3 2020, our total real estate revenue decreased by 45% to $3 million, and we reported a third quarter 2020 operating loss of $844,000. The decrease in our overall results was driven by a few key factors. Firstly, our live theaters in the U.S. remain closed for the entire third quarter due to government mandates. Secondly, our issuance of rent abatements to certain third-party tenants in Australia whose businesses were impacted by COVID. The last factor relates to the presentation in the real estate operating segment in our 10-Q only. In this particular financial table, we eliminated the accrual for the intercompany rent that our 12 Reading cinemas are charged by Reading as a landlord. This treatment is similar to the way we’ve handled other third-party tenants whose businesses were also impacted by COVID., These financial result declines were offset to some extent by the elimination in Australia of our third-party property management contracts, which reflects the continued strengthening of our internal property team; various property tax rebates and waivers achieved in Australia; the receipt of live theater license fee revenue from certain tenants, a reduction in operating expenses due to rent abatements from a ground lessor in Australia related to COVID-19; the commencement of straight-line rent attributable to our recently-signed full-floor tenant at our Culver City headquarters building in the U.S., Throughout the third quarter, we continue to offer short-term rental relief to our affected third-party tenants in Australia, with the expectation of ensuring their long-term viability as our tenants. In addition to our own negotiations, the Australian government and its state governments implemented a code of conduct which imposed a set of good faith leasing principles between landlords and tenants, whereby abatements and deferrals of rent were to be agreed., During Q3, we granted about A$121,000 in rent abatements to our third-party lease tenants in Australia. And no COVID-related rent abatements were offered in New Zealand. With respect to rent deferrals, we granted A$93.3000 in rent deferrals in Australia. The rent deferrals for Australia are to be repaid by tenants over a 24-month period once the code of conduct ends, which in most Australian states has been extended to December 31, 2020. As of today, 94% of our third-party lease tenants are open and trading, although some still have some trading restrictions., However, despite these tenants being opened, we expect that the impact of our negotiated rental concessions through abatements and deferral to be felt for the remainder of 2020. During Q3 2020 in Australia and New Zealand, where we have a combined total of 87 third-party tenants and 82 that are open and trading, we collected 97% of our billed recurring rents, including base rent and cost reimbursements in the third quarter. As of September 30, 2020, our combined Australian and New Zealand portfolio consists of 102 third-party tenancies with a gross leasable area of 348,373 square feet. Of our 102 third-party tenancies, almost 90% are currently occupied., During Q3 2020, we continued leasing activity by completing two new leases and a lease renewal at Cannon Park and a lease renewal at Newmarket Village, which collectively represented over 22,000 square feet. As mentioned last quarter, as a result of COVID, we have delayed all nonessential capital improvements in our Australian centers until we’re confident in our liquidity position. However, this has not impacted our commitment to certain tenant allowances and lessor works for a few lease deals that we deem essential to the long-term health of each center., Regarding our live theaters in the U.S., our continued expectation is that the Orpheum and Minetta Lane theaters will not resume public performances until mid-2021 due to government restrictions. We think that the Royal George in Chicago may open earlier than our New York City theaters. Again, understanding the impact that our long-term tenants face, we negotiated rent relief arrangements with certain producers who occupy our live theaters. With respect to capital expenditures, our management team continued to progress in key capital projects through COVID-19. Let’s talk about our 44 Union Square project in New York City. Subject to punch list items, the construction of this approximately 73,000 square foot building with a landmark facade and a one-of-a-kind 800 piece glass dome roof is now complete. In August 2020, we were pleased to receive a core and shell temporary certificate of occupancy for the historic Tammany Hall building, which allows tenants to come in and fit out their spaces in the building. Upon receiving the TCO, we began to incur depreciation expense., Particularly in light of the COVID impacts, we strongly believe that the location of the 44 Union Square project will be key to that property success. The building occupies a primary corner of Union Square, a key transportation hub in New York City, and in a location that offers tenants an abundance of amenities. Its prominence has led it to being included in general media shots of Union Square, just one more reason we believe that it’s one of a few brandable buildings in the area., We were asked by a stockholder about the leasing discussions we had with a large high-tech tenant for over 90% of the building. Those negotiations did occur pre-COVID and have now terminated with that potential tenant rethinking its space needs for New York City. Since the onset of COVID, we’ve had some leasing activity with letters of intent being exchanged and recently resumed hosting potential tenant tours of this space. However, we recognize that COVID-19 has definitely impacted the leasing market in New York City in the short-term. We’ve studied recovery periods in New York City after events like 9/11 and the global financial crisis. Though it may take some time, New York City clearly has a history of rebounding from dire and tragic events. Like so many others, we believe in the city’s long-term fundamentals., At the moment, we cannot offer any assurance as to when the building will be fully leased, and we don’t want to specify or quantify a dollar per square foot expectation. As of September 30, 2020, total construction debt against that property aggregates to $40.1 million. This loan carries an effective interest rate of 5.5%. At the end of December 2020, we have an additional one-year option to extend with Bank of the Ozarks. We’re currently on that loan and have a good – we’re current on that loan and have a good relationship with that lender., Based on recent appraisals on the property and conversations with people in debt markets, we believe that we can refinance the property and create additional liquidity for our company to buffer against any need to lease the property at fire-sale rates. We’re in the process of seeking to refinance our existing construction loan to free up cash. Although no assurances can be given, management is confident that this take-out financing will be finalized this year on satisfactory terms. In regard to our Culver City property, in October 2020, we began receiving cash rent and are now in the tenant improvement phase., Now, let’s turn to our real estate assets in New Zealand. During the COVID-19 period, we continued to address our two major property assets in New Zealand and focus on how to progress the development plans in light of our COVID-19 challenges. While we’ve been dealing with potential leasing and planning issues at Courtenay Central, we have no material updates to provide you during the third quarter., Turning now to our two parcels representing 70.4 acres or almost 3.1 million square feet of undeveloped industrial land located in the Manukau/Wiri area of Auckland, one of the most sought-after industrial areas of New Zealand, near the Auckland Airport. Over the last few years, these properties, based on recent appraisals, have materially increased in value due to both our rezoning and planning progress and market demand for industrial properties in the Auckland Airport area., Today, these two parcels remain unencumbered. During Q3 2020, we continued working on the planning for the discrete infrastructure projects required by the Auckland Council to start developing for light industrial uses. We’ve now obtained certain governmental approvals necessary to build significant portions of the infrastructure required to unlock the value of our property., In addition to design and permitting efforts, we focused our efforts on a potential contractual structure that could govern our relationship with our adjoining neighbors in a three-way joint development of the infrastructure improvements necessary to begin development., Over the next few months, before Reading makes any funding commitment, we’ll be satisfying ourselves that we have in place legal arrangement protective of Reading’s future interests and potential returns that fairly allocates the cost and benefits of the needed infrastructure, and a strategic overall plan that provides a positive economic outcome for our company., Now, before I turn it over to Gilbert for a financial review of the third quarter 2020, I wanted to say, on behalf of Margaret, our Board and myself, we again want to thank the people of Reading, who have remained dedicated to ensuring that our company survives these very uncertain times. 2020 has shaped up to be a year we will all want in the rear-view mirror. As the pandemic drags on, we know this hasn’t been easy., Our heartfelt thanks go out to all of you. Gilbert?, Gilbert Avanes, Thank you, Ellen. Consolidated revenue for the third quarter 2020 decreased significantly, by 86% to $10.2 million compared to the same period last year. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, revenue decreased by 70% to $62.8 million from the nine months ended September 30, 2019. These year-to-date decreases are primarily driven by temporary COVID-19 related closures of our 60 global cinemas and three live theaters in compliance with governmental directive starting in March 2020. We were able to recover some of the revenue losses in the second and third quarter due to the reopening of most of our Australia and New Zealand theaters in June and July of 2020, excluding our Courtenay Central cinema, which continues to be closed due to seismic issue, and partially reopened in the U.S. cinemas circuits., Additionally, during the third quarter of 2020, the Australian dollar and the New Zealand dollar strengthened by 4.4% and 2.1%, respectively, against the U.S. dollar. Net income attributable to RDI common stockholders decreased by $20.1 million to a loss of $19.2 million for the third quarter of 2020 compared to the net income of $0.9 million in the same period of the prior year., Basic earnings per share for the quarter ended September 30, 2020, decreased by $0.92 from prior year quarter to a loss of $0.88. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, net income attributable to RDI common stockholders declined by $48.9 million to a loss of $47.8 million, compared to the first nine months ended September 30, 2019. Basic earnings per share decreased by $2.25 to a loss of $2.20 compared to the same period of last year. Non-segment G&A expenses for the third quarter and the first nine months of 2020 decreased by 35% and 21% to $2.9 million and $11.2 million, respectively, due to the affirmation on the PL by Nevada Supreme Court of $0.8 million judgment entered in favor of our company in the James Cotter, Jr. derivative litigation., In addition, both the third quarter and year-to-date decreases are also due to savings in payroll costs as a result of wage subsidy programs in Australia and New Zealand, a reduction in corporate staff, along with reduction costs related to corporate airfare and travel as a result of COVID-19 travel restriction, a decrease in professional and legal services. The wage and subsidy program is currently experienced in New Zealand. The wage subsidy program in Australia currently goes through December 31, 2020, but was extended to March 27, 2021 under a reduced rate scheme, which requires a further application to be submitted for the first quarter of 2021. No assurance can be given that we will qualify for this scheme in Q1 2021 or if our application will be successful., Income tax benefit for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2020 increased by $1 million and $6.2 million, respectively, compared to the same period of the prior year. This is primarily driven by tax benefits from the carryback of the company’s 2019 net operating losses as a result of CARES Act, the 2015 and 2016 tax years where the federal tax rate was 35%, offset by an increase in valuation allowance in 2020. The carryback of 2019 net operating loss and the refund claim for 100% of the remaining alternative minimum tax credit will result in a tax refund of approximately $5.1 million receivable at September 30, 2020., For the third quarter of 2020, adjustable EBITDA decreased by $20.7 million compared to the same prior year to a negative adjusted EBITDA of $11.6 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, our adjusted EBITDA declined by $56 million to a negative adjusted EBITDA of $30.3 million. This decrease was primarily due to the flow-through of the net loss in the third quarter and for the year-to-date 2020, driven by COVID-19-related factors., Shifting to cash flow for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. Net cash used by operating increased by $38.8 million to net cash used of $28 million when compared to the same period of prior year. This was primarily driven by $51.3 million lower cash inflow from operating activities as well as $12.4 million decrease in net operating assets. Cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2020 decreased by $16.5 to $16.6 million, resulting from completion of the construction, except for minor punch-list items of our 44 Union Square property along with suspension of our cinema refurbishment activities due for COVID-19 shutdown when compared to the same period in 2019., Cash provided by financing activities was $57.3 million during the first nine months ended September 30, 2020 and was mainly a result of $87.8 million of new borrowings, offset by $28.9 million of loan repayments. The proceeds of the new borrowings are primarily being used to provide working capital for ongoing operations in U.S., Australia, and New Zealand as we weather the impact of COVID-19 global pandemic., Turning now to our financial position. Our total assets at September 30, 2020 decreased slightly to $673.4 million compared to $675 million at December 31, 2019, primarily driven by a decrease in operating, lease write-off use asset, offset by an increase in cash and cash equivalents., As Ellen mentioned, during the third quarter of 2020, we paid down $5.8 million on our Bank of America revolving credit facility. As of September 30, 2020, our total outstanding borrowings were $274.1 million. Our cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2020 were $27.8 million, which includes approximately $8.8 million in U.S., $6.2 million in Australia and $12.8 million in New Zealand., The required shutdown and other operational impact on our business due to COVID-19 pandemic related issue has severely reduced our liquidity from our operational sources. We have successfully negotiated certain modifications to our loan agreement with Bank of America, NAB and Westpac for the quarter ended September 30, 2020, and in some cases, into the future. These loan modifications include changes to some of our covenant compliance terms and waivers to certain covenant testing period., We currently have no covenant breaches for which loan modifications or waivers to the covenant testing periods have not been obtained. And to date, it has not been necessary for us to seek modifications or waivers with respect to our other loan agreements, as we continue to be in compliance with the terms of such loan agreements without the need for any such modification or waivers. We believe that our landlords understand that current situation is not of our making that are – that we are doing everything that can be reasonably done and that our relationship with our lenders is good., With respect to our Westpac facility, on September 15, 2020, Westpac waived interest coverage ratio test through September 30, 2020. The longer the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated legal and practical limitation on our business exists, the more likely, in the absence of other actions by our company, that we will be unable to continue to comply with these covenants. However, in such an event, our company expects to be able to obtain an amendment or a waiver from its lender, but no assurance can be given. In the absence of such waivers, it is our current intention to look to our real estate asset to provide needed liquidity., Total debt against our 44 Union Square property in Manhattan aggregates to $40.1 million. We are currently seeking takeout financing for that property. And while no assurance can be given, we are optimistic that a refinancing freeing of substantial capital can be finalized this year. This would allow us to have increased liquidity while we manage our business in light of COVID-19 impact. We did not repurchase any shares in the third quarter. And due to COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our overall liquidity, our stock repurchase program has and will likely continue to take a lower capital allocation priority for the foreseeable future., With that, I will now turn it over to Andrzej., Question-and-Answer Session"

To present the result today, our CFO, Trine Sæther Romuld and the CEO of Icelandic Salmon with us today, Björn Hembre live from the Westfjords in Iceland., As you can see behind me, we are once again presenting the results from InnovaMar, our main office and fantastic harvesting and processing facility. In this way, we get to show you where we belong and where the results is created. It is out here on the coastline right next to the ocean, SalMar produced millions of healthy salmon meals to people all over the world., But before we dive into the results, I would like to give you a great thanks for the efforts our employees are doing every single day. Despite strict restrictions due to the corona pandemic, SalMar has been running as normal, making it possible to send millions of salmon meals across the globe. It is our employees through the entire organization that make it possible for SalMar to again deliver strong results. And this is not a result of something extraordinary, but this is the result of long-term strategic and operational focus, giving us the strong SalMar culture with great passion and ability to find solution in challenging periods. I'm both humbled and proud for the efforts from our employees. We are a fantastic group of people that gives everything for each other and for the salmon., On the highlights, our long-term strategic and operational focus resulting in a good biological and operational performance has once again given us strong results. In Norway, we harvested 35,300 tons in Q3, with an operational EBIT of NOK669 million, with a margin of NOK18.92 per kilo. Including Icelandic Salmon, we harvested 37,100 tons with an operational EBIT of NOK647 million with a margin of NOK17.46 per kilo. Both Central and Northern Norway delivered strong results through solid operation and good biological performance. Despite a demand in quarter with high market uncertainty, Sales and Processing delivered record strong results., As commonly indicated in the previously quarterly presentation, we have increased our MAB capacity to purchase a traffic-light auction and the conversion of eight development licenses on OF1 and already know we have made good use of this as the biological development in the sea has been very good in both Central and Northern Norway., On Iceland, a successful private placement and listing was completed in October. And at the same time, the company has changed name to Icelandic Salmon. Björn will give you more details on this later on. The board recommends a dividend of NOK13 per share., To give you more details, I will now give the word to over CFO, Trine, table is yours., Trine Sæther Romuld, As usual, I will start with the Farming Central Norway, we harvested 30,100 ton in Central Norway in the quarter with operational EBIT of NOK526 million and as an EBIT per kilo NOK17.51. Strategic and operational focus over time has resulted in a strong result with good biological and operational performance. We did harvest a relative high volume in the beginning of the period, combined with high average weight that has given us a good price achievement in the quarter., This spring-2019 generation, accounted for more than 60% of the harvest volume, with continuous strong biological performance and low cost level. We started harvesting out from the autumn-2019 generation also with good biological development and our Ocean Farm 1 was the main contributor. In the current quarter, quarter four, we will continue harvesting from autumn-2019 with good biological status and good growth in this recently. We are already utilizing the increased MAB capacity since we are increasing our biomass., At the same time, increased MAB gives us flexibility to optimize the harvest profile on terms of the salmon. We expect costs to be at the same level in the quarter four. And the volume guidance for the year is kept unchanged, when it comes to guiding for next year. Gustav will comment that later on., Over to Farming Northern, we did harvest 5,300 ton in the quarter with operational EBIT of NOK61 million, which gives EBIT per kilo NOK11.55. As for Central Norway, this is also strong result, whereas spring 2019 has accounted for the volume with strong biological development in the period. Nevertheless, the result is negatively impacted in favorable due to harvest distribution as the entire volume was harvested in the last month, the period where the prices were lowest in the quarter, but high average weight has partly offset a negative impact., The biological status in the sea is good. And also here in Northern Norway, the growth has been very good, meaning that we are utilizing the increased MAB capacity that we recently has bought. We expect costs to be at the same level in the quarter four, where we will continue to harvest from the same location as for quarter three. As for the Central Norway, the guiding for the year is kept unchanged at 49,000 ton and we expect significantly higher volume in the quarter four. When it comes to guiding 2021, Gustav will comment that later on., Sales and processing; sales and processing delivers an operational EBIT of NOK156 million in the quarter. This is a very strong result in a period with high market uncertainty due to COVID-19. Actually, it's the second best quarter ever for sales and processing in SalMar. However, we're still focused on local processing, strengthens the results. Combined with higher volume to harvesting and processing plant and solid operational performance, this has given strong margin from our harvesting and operational activities and spot sales., As expected, the quarter has given a lower price level due to seasonality. This has given increased positive contribution from our fixed price contracts. The contract share was 25% in the quarter. In quarter four, the contract share is expected to be at the same level around 35%. Construction of InnovaNor is continuing as planned. And in the quarter, all the leaders for each department has been employed, which will start the work in January 1 next year. We look forward to the summer next year, when we can use the facility and process our own fish locally on SalMar., Icelandic Salmon; as mentioned in the previous quarterly reporting, Icelandic Salmon delivers a weak result in this quarter. We harvested 1,700 tons with operational EBIT negative with NOK22 million and negative EBIT per kilo NOK12.89 – NOK12.81, sorry. The result is impacted by high cost and weak price achievement. The 2018 generation accounted for the volume in the period and was finished in the quarter. As previously communicated, high mortality earlier this year has led to high cost level on this generation., In addition, seasonality, low prices in the quarter has affected Iceland significantly with challenging freight condition. In addition, the company, that can sell most of its volume in Europe, hasn't got the same positive currency impact effect as the Norwegian business. But the good thing is that the 2018 generation is now finished, and in quarter four, we will have already started to harvest out from the 2019 generation, which has shown significantly improved biological performance and lower cost lower level. But the period we are in right now, with low spot prices, will continue to affect the results from Icelandic Salmon also in quarter four., Volume guidance for 2020 is kept unchanged at 12,000 ton. And as such, we therefore expect higher volume and lower cost level in quarter four. For next year, we expect to harvest 14,000 in 2021. The name of the company has been changed to Icelandic Salmon to strengthen the brand SalMar. And Björn Hembre will tell you more about that later., At the same time, in October, a successful private placement and following listing on Merkur Market was completed. Through this, we have gotten aboard strong institution in Iceland with us to further develop the company and also to work to develop the sustainable salmon farming in Iceland. This is something we in SalMar are very pleased with and something that we strongly believe is important for Icelandic Salmon to succeed in a way forward., Scotland; Scottish Sea Farms harvested 8,100 ton in the quarter and delivers a good operational EBIT of NOK101 million and EBIT per kilo NOK12.45. The volume harvested in the quarter is according to our expectation and plans. We harvested out from all region in the period with good results. The positive development with lower cost compared to previous quarters continuous, due to good biological performance with good growth and low mortality rates. Volume for 2020 is kept unchanged at 26,000 ton and the company expects to harvest 36,000 ton in 2021., And some comments to the financial updates. I would start with a comparison with the previous quarter. First under the Norwegian activities. We have a reduction in EBIT per kilo of NOK4.32 compared with previous quarter that is due to limited decrease in net sales price due to strong price achievement, despite lower spot price, comparing as that every spot price quarter to quarter is NOK10.30 lower in the quarter. Costs are slightly higher due to change of harvesting generations. So that is the main explanation. And at the bottom, we are doing the same comparison for the group where we also include the Icelandic Salmon., P&L, some comments to the P&L in quarter where we compare with the same period last year. Higher revenue due to increased volume and stronger price achievements despite lower spot prices. We see that both EBITDA and operational EBIT is increased as a consequence of this combined with lower cost. We have also some fair value adjustment this quarter, and it's negative due to time factor in present value calculation, longer time to harvest, despite higher volume in the calculation., Other financial items, negative due to transition to hedge accounting. Income from associates that is mainly from Scottish Sea Farm both in 2020 and 2019 were positive this quarter due to improved results. So comparing group EBIT per kilo from the same quarter last year, we have improved prices even our stock is lower and we have lower cost. Balance sheet. Some comments to the balance sheet. And there we are comparing to the last quarter and the quarter two. Investments are progressing according to plan, increasing noncurrent tangible assets, noncurrent intangible assets are increasing following an investment in the traffic light auction and the conversion of the development licenses., Standing biomass are higher, both comparing same quarter last year, but also previous quarter, both in number of fish also in average weight. Net interest-bearing debt that's now including leasing, as well have increased with NOK1.6 billion in the quarter. And we have – the total figure is now NOK4.1 billion. In total, still a solid financial position with an equity share of 55.4% and including leasing ratio towards EBITDA is 1.03. And also worth mentioning, we had the successful private placement for Icelandic Salmon that was completed in October, which will increase the equity from quarter four., Some comments in the movement in net interesting-bearing debt for the quarter. Starting to the left including also leasing, EBITDA increase, reducing the net interesting-bearing debt and then you could see that then made sure item here is the investment. We have our CapEx program ongoing, and also Gustav will show you some nice picture later in the presentation, but the biggest single item here is the licenses from the traffic light auction. We expect to invest approximately NOK1.6 billion in Norwegian operation in 2021, now that is maintenance investment NOK0.3 billion and capacity investment NOK1.3 billion. Other potential investment will be announced when final investment decision is taken. And we also expect to investment approximately NOK170 million in the Icelandic Salmon in 2021., Results so far in 2020 have shown that SalMar is well positioned to handle the demanding market. We have delivered strong operational financial result, and therefore also maintaining a solid financial position. For the Board of Directors in SalMar, it's important that the company has a solid balance sheet and a solid liquidity resource, which the figure from quarter three clearly indicates. At the same time, the Board wants to provide our more than 8,000 shareholders, a competitive and attractive return on investment by paying out surplus liquidity, taking into account of future growth plans in SalMar., The Board therefore recommends dividends of NOK13 per share for the financial year 2019 to be paid out in December 2020. At the same time, the Board has also updated the dividend policy with long-term financial goals and the clarification of the payout forms of dividends. The financial – long-term financial goals is set to EBIT including leasing ratio to EBITDA. So in the long-term, it will be in the interval of 1 to 2. Given that the company, so within this interval and taking into account future investment, intention is to payout surplus liquidity. In addition to ordinary cash dividends, the company will also aim to return capital to the shareholders through share buybacks in the market for later consolation. More information is available in the notice of the extraordinary general meeting for December 4, 2020. And for clarification, dividends for the financial year 2020 will as usual be announced at the next quarterly presentation., Then I want to give the floor back to you. Gustav?, Gustav Witzøe, Thank you, Trine. Thank you for a good presentation. Before I pass it over to Björn, I would like to briefly inform why we – in SalMar, believe in salmon production on Iceland. For us, there are some key criteria that must be in place. It is important for us that the production is sustainable and on the salmon terms. And we find that starting point on Iceland. It all starts with good biological conditions for the salmon. Iceland has this both in relation to water quality, temperature, location, and so on. Iceland has also had a strong history and culture on living over what the ocean has to offer. This combined, we knowhow on the farming industry from Iceland combined with SalMar experience gives a good foundation for the continuing development of Icelandic Salmon., With all this, there is ocean of opportunity on Iceland, but it will take time to reach the full potential. Iceland also has room for growth through both increased utilization of existing licenses, but in the longer term, also with opportunities for expansion of current capacity. Bjorn will now give you more insight – sorry, Björn will now give you more insight into how we think about the way forward on Iceland. Björn has a long history in SalMar and he knows both in the SalMar culture and the mindset in SalMar as well. Combined with the culture and knowledge that lies in Iceland is a very good starting point. But before I give the floor to him, we want to show you a video that shows the idea over wonderful colleagues and all my staff are working every single day., [Video Presentation], Björn Hembre, Thank you, Gustav. And I can confirm that natural condition in the Iceland is very good for salmon production. I found that salmon has today maximum allowed by market 25,200 tones in the Southern part of that West Fjords to Iceland. We have additional applications for 14,500 tons, 10,000 in Ísafjarðardjúp, which we expect in 2021 and 4,500 tons in Arnarfjörður, which we expect in 2022. We put a 50% chance on both of these applications that we get them. So far all licensed applications on Iceland have ended with our license. We see a potential for organic growth to our existing licenses for the coming two to three years, and expect to see an effect for the new licenses in 2023 and 2024. Our goal is to harvest 30,500 tons in 2024 if we have the new licenses in hand., We have a fully-integrated value chain in Icelandic Salmon for our smolt production, we have two small plants, Bæjarvík with our capacity or 2 million smolt and we own 50% of Eastwood on the South Coast of Iceland with a capacity of 2.5 million smolt next year, a total of 4.5 million smolts in 2021. If there are available smolts in the market or good quality, we are also open for by that., Our Seawater sites are located in the West Fjords, Arnarfjörður, Tálknafjörður and Patreksfjörður with a total maximum allowed biomass of 25,200 tons today. Then, we have our harvest plant in Bildudalur, with a capacity of 30,000 ton today. And in the harvest plant, we also harvest the salmon for neighbors, Arctic Fish. Our sales department sells all our fish out in the markets, which is mainly Europe, U.S. and China. Europe has the latest time in our far biggest market due to the logistic and the market challenges in U.S. and China., We have taken the first step towards branding of our fabulous product or changing name or the Norwegian mother company to Icelandic Salmon. We think that there is a value to catch on the origin of our SalMar, the sustainable production and strong seafood heritage on Iceland. We see that other salmon producing regions are able to catch a premium by promoting the benefits of the production like the federal Ireland and Scotland, and we feel our product might be even more unique and that should give us a base for getting a premium out of the market. The fact that we are in a global scale, a low-volume producer after all is beneficial in this process. This is our job that I’ve just started and I know building up a strategy towards promoting this brand when we have everything in place., We feel that we are getting in a position, where we will provide a long-term value creation on our licenses in the West Fjords of Iceland. We have been operating over some years, learned from lessons, but have seen that we are able to compete cost-wise with older salmon producing regions. We see that we have benefits when it comes to infectious diseases like PD and ISA that is not all Iceland and on sea lice as well. There, we are able to have lower costs than our competitors on these matters. Then, we have a slightly higher cost for transport into the market that we see an improvement – and we see an improvement that are based on the fact that the scale of the production is coming up., The licensed portfolio is attractive and should, over the coming years, take us over 30,000 tons of harvest volume. We see that is our strength that we are fully integrated and have a control of the value chain from hatchery to sales. There is a strong focus on sustainability within the company, and also by the Icelandic government. there is made our risk assessment by the Marine Research Institute of Iceland for protecting the mine stocks that is made for East Fjords and are evaluated every third year to see that the following farming don’t affect the live stocks – wild stocks., Last time, this was evaluated – last year and then it increased from 70,000 tons to 106,000 tons on Iceland in total. The Marine Research Institute also calculates the carrying capacity for East Fjords, so that there will be no overload or organic waste. In Icelandic Salmon, we have a dedicated management team that get away very good backing from salmon and we work to develop the company culture through the Analog Academy, similar to the SalMar school, trying to build a good culture in the company. We also have been active in developing vocational training together with the expected school in Iceland and that is our very important part of building infrastructure for the industry on Iceland., Gustav Witzøe, Thank you, Björn. In my presentation, I often speak about static and operational focus. Therefore, I want to spend some time on detailing what I really mean about this. We shall have sustainable value chain; build on that terms of the salmon from the road to the finished product everything we do must be done with the salmon and the customer in focus. This start at the very beginning with the row, we must have the right row with the right qualities for us to succeed on the entire value chain and we must have the right flexibility and capacity to produce and deliver the right smolt, with right quality and size and at right time., We shall produce this in the optimal location that has the optimal growth conditions for salmon with a minimal footprint. This means that our production needs to be adapted to each individual locations, conditions, with the right smolt, right people and the optimal operation regime. Through good fish welfare, this gives us the best salmon that is ready for harvesting when the salmon has reached its potential. This means that we must have the right flexibility and the capacity to handle a fish when it arrived to our harvesting and processing plants. For local processing, so we can maximize the value creation of the salmon in the market., The fact that the salmon is harvested when it really gives us the best quality, flexibility, and capacity means that we can meet market requirements; both in terms of volume and product type, this to ensure that we have the best product for our customers all around the world. This is what we work with every single day and this is only possible with a strong culture and a fantastic, and please we have the experience, see the opportunities and a willingness to go the extra mile and make sure that we are in that front position every day., In the strategic and operational focus in the entire value chain that is the basis for the large investments, we now make in a robust platform for future growth. People on culture, even in a challenging time with a COVID-19, we must ensure that everyone is seen, and that is safe to go to work. This means that we must comply with all the measures we impose to reduce the possibility of infections, while maintaining the passion and energy for what we are working with the salmon. We will continue to take social responsibility and we will ensure that we continue to focus on the solution and that everything, we do today, we’ll do better than yesterday., On the smolt; in smolt development on Senja is well underway. This would be an important competence center for us in our future growth. At the same time, we are continuing the planning of a new smolt facility in Central Norway and we are in the final phase of using a completely new closed net open for post-smolt production in the sea., The coastal farming. We said that release in the details when it comes to optimizing our coastal production. We’re constantly working to improve ourselves and we will ensure that we share the best practice, so we can minimize the difference between a good and a less good performing farms. In this way, we will ensure an even more optimal utilization of our location and our MTB., Offshore farming. A milestone has been reach when we have converted that the development licenses and we are now planning for the next smolt release in OF1. At the same time, we have started a project, where we look at the possibilities to build a new ocean farm unit for use in the exposed sites within the current production regime. We’re planning for a new open ocean unit to Smart Fish Farm is continuing as planned. In all these projects, we take you those all the learnings the first two production cycles of OF1 has given us, where we will make all the necessary improvements for our way forward., In the next quarterly presentation, we plan to bring with us Olav-Andreas Ervik, which is the CEO in SalMar Ocean, who will give you further details and how we think about the way forward in offshore farming and how all of this can be a significant growth catalyst for the entire industry., Industry and sales, [indiscernible] with high market uncertainty has shown us how important it is to have a flexible local processing capacity. In the one word, it's moving forward as planned and we look forward to the summer of 2021, when the plant is ready for its first harvest. At the same time, we can go, it's now on the final phases for upgrading its plant, which will be completed in the end of this year, and will be in full production from January 2021., So to the outlook and we are going forward and we'll continue with our strong operational focus. Again, what we do today, we do better than yesterday. We will continue to have focus on the things we can impact and do something with. We have good financial results come from good biological conditions and operations on the salmon terms. SalMar wish to – and strengthen our position as the technology leader in the aquaculture industry, to become an even larger contributor for sustainable growth in the future. Therefore, our offshore project are continuing as planned. This will also make us more robust to handle demanding period in the future., To be the strong and robust platform for future growth, we expect to invest NOK1.6 billion in Northern Norway, and $170 million in Iceland in 2021. As mentioned by Trine, the board recommends a dividend at over NOK13 per share. At the moment, we are experiencing good biological status in the sea in all our regions. The volume guidance for 2020 is unchanged and increased MAB [ph] have given us the ability to optimize over harvesting profile., Overall, we expect slightly higher volume and cost at the same level in quarter four, significantly lower volume and stable cost in Central Norway, significantly higher volume and stable costs in Northern Norway and higher volume and lower cost on Iceland. The contract share is around 25% for quarter four. In 2021, we expect future growth in volume in Norway 163,000 ton, Iceland, 14,000 ton and we expect 36,000 ton in our associated company in Scotland, Scottish Sea Farms., We expect low supply growth in 2021, the same time – at the same time Covington has lead to increase market uncertainty, somewhere it’s well positioned to handle at the mining market with strong operational and financial flexibility, another positive view for the future for salmon. Our job is to implement the measures that strengthens us today and at the same time will make us even stronger going forward. We focus on the solution, not the problems., With this, we have come to the end of our presentation and we'd like to thank all of you who have been watching. Our next quarterly presentation will be in February, until then, we hope you all stay safe and healthy and eat a lot of salmon. Thank you very much., Question-and-Answer Session"

I think we are officially live. So, good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us. My name is Peter Arment, senior aerospace defense analyst here at Baird. We're very happy to be hosting American Airlines here this morning., With American Airlines we have Robert Isom, President; Derek Kerr, CFO; and Dan Cravens, Managing Director of Investor Relations. Really appreciate gentlemen all of you for joining us and hopefully everyone is staying safe. I wish we were doing this live with you. But hopefully that will happen next year. But then again thank you again for your time. I'll kick it over to you. You go through some slides and if we have some time at the end we'll go through a little bit of Q&A. Thanks again. , Robert Isom, Thanks, Peter. I appreciate it. And we'll pull our slides up here real quick. , Dan Cravens, Where is the deck?, Robert Isom, Hold on one second. This is why no travel is going to come back, because I'll tell you what meeting in person would be much easier. Okay., Dan Cravens, Peter, can you see these slides?, Peter Arment, Not yet, but I think they will -- hopefully they'll be able to put them up for everyone., Dan Cravens, Go back and bring…, Robert Isom, Okay. Well, Peter, you can't but I'm going to go ahead and give the -- I'm going to start the presentation if that's okay., Peter Arment, Yeah. Well, we'll see if they can get the sharing your screen up shortly. And if not then we can just begin to talk to your side., Robert Isom, Okay., Dan Cravens, Here we go. All right., Robert Isom, Got them. Everybody see them?, Peter Arment, Yes., Robert Isom, Okay. So hey we'll go ahead and click through. Obviously there's yes the cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements and information on the next slide Dan? There we go. Okay., So, hey, look we're coming into the third quarter and I'll tell you what none of us ever seen, like, anything like this before. The pandemic has created a challenging environment to say the least and the third quarter was representative of that., Revenue down 73% to $3.2 billion, and we concluded the quarter with $13.6 billion in liquidity, $15.6 billion on a pro forma basis, which is inclusive of the CARES Act loan and the upsizing of that., But hey we are laser focused on making sure that American is well prepared to weather the storm. And so we have been paying really close attention to raising cash, reducing spending wherever we can, and then starting to encourage travelers to come back when they feel that they're ready. And as a result, our aggressive actions they've positioned us to really I think perform as demand returns. We've got a strong liquidity position. It gives us a runway with very few near-term maturities. We've taken structural cost actions that will live long beyond the pandemic that are reducing our cash burn right now. And a lot of the work that we've been doing is really accelerated and fast forward putting a network in place to best serve the marketplace. And we're doing everything we can to get customers back with our clean commitment., So next slide, Dan. So in terms of liquidity, now, here's a quick look going back to June -- the end of June where we had $10.2 billion of liquidity. But then adding to that the treasury loan and also $1.2 billion financing with Goldman Sachs. That gave us a $15.6 billion pro forma liquidity at the end of the quarter. As we take a look forward, look, we're doing everything we can to maintain and to certainly limit any deterioration. I think everybody knows that through an ATM and block trade transaction, we've added to what will be a year-ending liquidity number by $1.3 billion. So we're estimating year-end to have $14.5 billion of liquidity, which is certainly enough to weather the storm ahead., Next slide. So with that who knows what comes up, and certainly we've been -- we're optimistic with the development of vaccine that are testing in therapeutics. But we're going to be ready no matter what happens. And to that end, we have additional levers to pull for liquidity, $3.2 billion, almost $3.3 billion of unencumbered assets and also capacity under existing financings of almost of over $7 billion as well. So, look we haven't had to tap into that yet, but it's available if we need to. And so far we've been able to manage through the crisis well from a liquidity perspective., So in terms of maturities this is I think really important, and hopefully, a differentiator for American. Look, the maturities that we have going forward are certainly manageable. As we take a look at the 2021, $400 million, that's an undrawn line of credit. And if you take a look at the other dashed box, that's the undrawn U.S. treasury loan. But between those, we have a $750 million unsecured note. But outside of that, the dark blue bars, the $2.1 billion in 2023, the $1.7 billion in 2025 and the $1.1 billion out in 2027, those are all term loans that got solid collateral underneath and slots gates and racks. And we think that we're really well suited., Even the drawn revolver in 2024, look, once we repay that we anticipate retaining that capacity for additional liquidity going forward. So certainly, efficient, flexible, manageable., Okay. Action that we've taken to limit the outflow. We've been really aggressive striking first with getting our fleet made as efficient as possible pulling forward decisions that we had hoped to make over the coming years retiring 76s, 75s, A330-200s, A330-300s, E190s making the operations simpler in terms of sparing, provisioning, staffing for pilots and flight attendants., And we've removed and deferred really every bit of non-critical CapEx that we've been able to. So $700 million in 2020, already $300 million out in 2021. And then of course, in terms of what it takes to run an airline, it takes a lot of people. We've – through furloughs and leaves, and early retirements, we've reduced our team count by 40,000 people. So what's that meant in terms of reducing cash burn, sequentially better quarter-after-quarter and estimating the fourth quarter to be in the $25 million to $30 million per day range., So our goal is to get back to cash positive as soon as possible. It's going to take a return of air travel to do that. That's really what's standing in the way between us and that target. We're looking to make sure that our network is really designed around where we can make a return the fastest. And we anticipate that international travel is going to be slow and we are taking aggressive action to make sure that we're sized for demand as that returns., And then we've gone through the largest reinvestment and fleet renewal program, really in commercial aviation history. So we have a fleet that is set well and aircraft that are coming off of lease and the older aircraft that can be put down, that gives us a great amount of flexibility., So that fleet simplification strategy, I want to underscore that next slide Dan is something we've had in mind for some time but we've really focused on simplifying, yet still being able to meet demand in whatever pockets that it resides. So we started back in 2016 with 46 different sub-fleet types and whether it's operators, or seating configurations, or pilot and flight attendant, different type of configurations, all that is just inefficiency in terms of being able to go to the marketplace. We're being able to resource for providing the service., So as I said, we like where we're at in terms of fleet. We don't have a major renewal to do, certainly compared to our largest competitors. As you can see, we have the youngest fleet of the major network carriers. That's going to serve us well in terms of fuel efficiency. And these aircraft are sized for the demand that we see in the marketplace as well. So a benefit that will extend long beyond. And I think this – and the prior slide is important., Look while we've reduced a tremendous amount of operating and capital costs in 2020, there's a good chunk $1 billion of that that we think is permanent and that will continue on long into the future and we're going to try to do everything we can to make that even bigger., So, underlying all this is that American has a network that will perform certainly in the future. But even now as you take a look our philosophy has been to concentrate our flying that we do do where we can take the best advantage. That's been ensuring that we have the greatest level of connectivity and getting people to where they want to go., And right now, they want to go to places in the Sun Belt where things are open. They want to go to close in Caribbean and Mexico. And our results have shown that we've positioned the network appropriately right now, certainly through our unit revenue outperformance in the third quarter., And our focus going forward is to make sure that our network stays as flexible as possible. You will see us continue to try to leverage our assets in DFW and Charlotte to the greatest extent possible and making sure that we can provide a network where people want to go. So, we're really pleased with what we've done in limiting down international travel, refocusing the capacity where it needs to be., And a note that I think is really of importance is one out three passengers flew American in the third quarter. That's one out of three passengers that flew in the entire United States. So, that bodes well for us as we look to the future., So, that's how we focused our domestic network. But look that domestic network really combines with an already fantastic set of relationships and partners through joint business or other relationships that put us in a position to serve more city pairs, more nonstop markets, and more destinations than anyone., And so as we take a look out into the future in Los Angles, New York, Chicago, the biggest markets where people are going to want to go, we have strong positions. And we're only adding to that and we're adding to it next slide in a way that it's asset-light., Look parts of our network over time out West, Los Angeles, in California, in New York haven't performed as well as other parts of our network. And so we're bolstering that through relationships with Alaska which is kicked off and I think in good position moving forward., We're really pleased with that partnership and can't wait to see where that goes. A terrific partner. We have the same teed up with JetBlue and hopefully get that started in the coming months and even internationally, we've made sure that we've augmented where we need to. So, building the relationship with Qatar reestablishing that., And then also with GOL, the largest domestic Brazilian carrier and one that fits incredibly well into our network. So, what are we doing to get passengers back and trying to reassure the safety of travel? Well it's -- it all comes down to making sure that people know that when they travel -- look it's -- you can't -- you couldn't be in a safer place than on an aircraft. And whether that's through asking our customers to fill out a checklist mandating face coverings doing everything including helping develop the latest in terms of coronavirus-killing devices and procedures and working with manufacturers that is all going in the right direction., And then using, of course, the aircraft themselves in HEPA filtration and enhancing the cleaning throughout. Look it's making a difference -- and so next slide Dan, it's making a difference and we see it in terms of certainly infection rates of our own team members which are lower than the U.S. on average. And then most importantly, the lowest infection rates are really among our most customer-facing team members, our agents, and our flight attendants. And that clean commitment that we've embarked on with an outside travel advisory panel, getting certification from the Global Biorisk Council, partnerships with companies like PURELL, mandating face coverings. And as I said, disinfectant advancements and electrostatic spring that is really I think, best in the industry. And then also looking to give our customers the control that they need, so that, look, you really don't have to touch anything. You can interact and keep control of your itinerary as you want to. It's making an impact and we're using that then to try to open markets., And so, we're opening markets, working with governments. We've had some success in terms of launching testing programs, both to Hawaii, but then also into the Caribbean as well. Jamaica is the most recent and you'll see even more, as we're working with countries setting up testing regimens, giving easy ways for customers to get tested before or even on the day of travel. It's working, it's making a difference. And it's helping these countries be able to take travelers in and to do it in a very safe way., So as a result of that and work throughout the industry, we are seeing a gradual increase in terms of overall bookings and travelers. And so the slide that I note here is the TSA traveler throughput, that's very representative of what we're seeing as well. Of course, there's been a little bit of a flattening as we've gotten into the election and certainly the spike in COVID. But still the trend is upwards and we expect that to continue., Now, one of the things I think is important to note as well is that, most of the travel that we see right now is highly leisure based. And there's a lot of questions about, hey, well what happens? When will -- how dependent are you on business travel? When does that come back? And the chart on the right is just simply showing, look, the major, the big companies that are out there, look, they're not traveling much at all, but they really fit into a segment of managed corporate business for us, which represents about 16% of our total revenues in 2019., So it's big, but it's something that we're not waiting for to come back. We're certainly working very closely with the small and medium-sized businesses, which are starting to move at a greater pace. And even within the managed corporates we do see some movement right now, in terms of improvement, in terms of government travel and industrials. So the big point here is that, look, American is -- certainly wants business travel to get back as soon as possible, but we're not waiting on it. And for American it's less a proportion of our overall base than you might think., All right. So rolling that all together is just important. We haven't waited and we've certainly taken advantage of the downturn to make sure that we get American position to lead as demand returns. And so, whether that's making sure that we have the liquidity to take on whatever comes ahead of us, really getting down and taking advantage of the opportunity to get our airlines sized right with the right assets in the right places, rebounding from what was just an underperforming 2019 for American for a number of reasons. We think that we're going to come out of this very well., The network strength that we have has only been improved based on new relationships that we put in place. And some of the things that we're doing to ensure customer safety and cleanliness is just going to be part of what we do going into the -- what we do going long into the future. And I think it's going to give confidence far beyond what we're doing right now. And that adds up into maximizing the value for all of our stakeholders., Look, we're going to produce a return that is where we're headed. We're going to get to positive cash flow as soon as we possibly can. We've got efficiencies in the organization. Our network strengths delivering operational excellence, it adds up to what I believe is a bright future for American and we're definitely looking to the future., So with that, Peter, I'm happy to engage Derek and to anybody that wants to ask any questions and have at it., Question-and-Answer Session"

Bernstein & Co., LLC., Mark Freshney – Crédit Suisse, Dominic Nash – Barclays, Jenny Ping – Citi, Sam Arie – UBS, Verity Mitchell – HSBC, Chris Laybutt – Morgan Stanley, Elchin Mammadov – Bloomberg, Martin Young – Investec Bank plc, Nick Ashworth, Thank you, Felicia, and good morning, everybody, and welcome to our Half Year Results Presentation. Thank you for joining us remotely. I hope you're safe and well. So firstly, I'd just like to draw your attention to the cautionary statement you'll find at the front of the presentation. Secondly, after the presentation, as usual, the IR team will be available by phone to help if you have any further questions., And so with that, I'd like to hand over to our CEO, John Pettigrew. John?, John Pettigrew, Thank you, Nick, and good morning, and welcome, everyone. As usual, I'm here with Andy Agg, our CFO. And after our respective presentations this morning, we will, of course, take any questions you have. But before discussing our performance in the first half of the year, I want to start with an update on how we've been managing against the backdrop of COVID and the impact it's been having across our businesses. Overall, the business has adapted incredibly well to new ways of working over the past eight months., Despite the new regulations and restrictions COVID has brought, operationally, we've delivered safe, reliable networks for our customers whilst making strong progress in key areas, such as capital investment, where we've delivered on our substantial investment program, broadly in line with the first half of last year; the U.S., where we've had to respond to a greater number of storms; cost discipline, where we've made good progress in mitigating some of the COVID cost pressure as well as continue to shape the organization for the challenges and opportunities ahead; progress on regulation, as we work towards settlements across our U.K. and downstate New York businesses, and we've done this whilst ensuring we behave as a responsible and purpose-led business, ensuring continued focus on our safety culture, supporting our people, for example, by increasing our focus on mental health and well-being and supporting our communities, our customers and our supply chain. So I'm really pleased with the way the business has stepped up and delivered a strong first half performance., Turning to the numbers. On an underlying basis that is excluding the impact of timing, exceptional items and remeasurements, operating profit of £1.15 billion was 11% below the prior year at constant currency. This largely reflects increased COVID-related costs, particularly in the U.S., higher storm costs in the period, although these were partly offset by expected revenue increases in the U.S. and significantly better operating profit in UK Gas Transmission, given the low rate set in the first half of last year., Andy will go into more detail on the financial impact of COVID, but our full year guidance from June remains unchanged. And as I mentioned in June, given current regulatory mechanisms and precedents, we expect to recover the majority of the COVID impacts over the medium term. Underlying earnings per share was down by 14% to 17.2 pence for the period, and the Board has proposed an interim dividend of 17 pence per share, reflecting 35% of last year's total dividend, which is in line with our policy., Investment in critical infrastructure remained strong with CapEx of £2.6 billion. This was driven predominantly by continued investment in large capital programs in our UK Electricity Transmission business, continued high levels of U.S. CapEx, much of it mandated on safety spend and increased spend in National Grid ventures as we progress our interconnector projects. Overall, we maintain our financial guidance for the year and expect investment to be around £5 billion, driving asset growth towards the top half of our 5% to 7% range. So, a strong half of operational performance, albeit like all companies, COVID costs have had an impact on our financial results., Turning now to our safety and reliability performance. On safety, our businesses have continued to deliver good performance with their lost time injury frequency rates trending down. However, 2021 has brought unique safety challenges as a result of COVID, which has required us to adapt our processes. For example, in the U.S., at the onset of the pandemic, our safety team has created our COVID-19 health and safety plan for all employees and contractors. They delivered over 400 field visits across our operations in the month of May to ensure the new ways of working and safety expectations were clear. This has allowed us to deliver our critical investment with limited disruption., Turning to reliability, performance has remained strong across our businesses. We've successfully managed low levels of demand, particularly in the U.K., with the Electricity System Operator developing new flexibility tools to maintain security of supply. And in the U.S., we responded to a series of big storms, including one of the biggest ever in early October, where we saw over 550,000 customers lose power. I'm pleased to say that the response was excellent with a tremendous performance from the team. Looking ahead to the coming winter in the U.K., the Electricity System Operator published its outlook last month and forecast an electricity capacity margin of 8.3%, lower than last year, a little well within the security standards."
