I'm Susan. I'm delighted to be here today in my role as Pennon's CEO. I'm joined by my colleague Paul, our Group Finance Director. And together we will walk you through the key elements of our 2020 half year results in a socially distanced and safe way., I believe today's results demonstrate Pennon's ongoing resilience and ability to deliver sustained performance responsibly. This is all the more reassuring in a world dominated by the uncertainty of COVID where the devastation on businesses and societies is being felt every day in so many ways and continues to do so., I really want to pay tribute to the extraordinary commitment and resilience of our colleagues at this time, allowing us to continue to deliver for our customers and communities., Before looking at the half year results, I wanted to talk about our new vision and purpose. Our reshaping of the group with a focus on U.K. water together with the impact of COVID on society and communities has been a catalyst for us in reviewing our purpose and considering the widest social contract or New Deal we should have with our customers and the communities we serve., We all know that water companies have a vital role today and every day providing customers with safe and clean drinking water and in our region clean bathing waters with the importance that has on health and hygiene bringing water to life. So that might be a given., At Pennon we also believe we have a unique role to play in supporting the lives of people and the places they love for generations to come. For us it is not just about what we do, but how we do it and that's why we strive to live our core values daily and operate in the public interest., That brings us on to our sustainable future focus areas. For example, our responsibility for natural capital stewardship and the public interest commitment to come net zero by 2030 influences the way we operate now and I will touch on some of those examples today whether it's leading the way with our working catchments, nurturing biodiversity on our sites or ensuring our investments like our new Mayflower treatment works operate in a much more sustainable and renewable way., Affordability and water poverty is one of the strategic priorities to address for our business. Our bills are lower today than they were over 10 years ago. And we have a good track record of providing innovative solutions to address affordability and vulnerability in our communities but there is still more to do., Finally in supporting Build Back Better and the green recovery, we have an opportunity to make a bigger and more societal contribution whether that's through promoting social mobility, addressing racial and gender inequality or in providing secure jobs where all employees are paid fairly for their work they do., I believe by focusing on all these things, it builds ongoing trust and confidence in us as a business whether you're a shareholder a customer or an employee. At Pennon, we'd like to call it profit with purpose guided by our values., So turning to the half year results. I'm pleased to report that we have had a good start to the K7 regulatory periods, delivering on our plans and continuing to demonstrate financial discipline. At the headline position, equity returns as measured by the WaterShare return on regulated equity are 8% at the half year, double the base return in Ofwat's final determination. We are on track or ahead of 80% of our outcome delivery commitments. And we have continued our efficiency momentum delivering £30 million of totex outperformance this half year and have locked in efficiency., Our effective interest rate of 2.5% for this half year is 90 basis points lower compared to the last half year. The sale of Viridor completed in July has resulted in a profit to the income statement in the half year of £1.7 billion. In line with our values we've adopted a responsible approach to the use of proceeds by repaying debt at the Pennon level and paying into our pension scheme considering the needs of all our stakeholders., In terms of deploying the remaining proceeds, we continue with our highly disciplined approach in assessing potential investment opportunities. We have worked extensively to narrow these down and they've been benchmarked against the return of capital to shareholders. If a compelling value-creating acquisition is not available, capital will be returned to shareholders., Speaking of shareholders, we have been developing our shareholder base and we've established a unique new relationship with shareholders customers and I'm pleased to report we have shared £20 million of returns with our customers either as a credit on their bill or as Pennon shares, one in 16 households across the regions are now shareholders in Pennon. Importantly this means that both customers and shareholders alike can benefit from our sector-leading dividend policy, which is growing the dividend by 2% plus inflation measured by CPIH., I will now hand over to Paul to talk in more detail about the half year financial performance.",,1,0

With us today from the company are Chairman and CEO, Ms. Angeliki Frangou; Chief Financial Officer, Mr. George Achniotis; Vice Chairman, Mr. Ted Petrone; and Senior Vice President of Strategic Planning, Mr. Ioannis Karyotis. As a reminder, this conference call is being webcast. To access the webcast, please go to the Investors section of Navios Maritime Holdings website at www.navios.com., You'll see the webcast link in the middle of the page and a copy of the presentation referencing today's earnings conference call will also be found there. Now I will review the safe harbor statement. This conference call could contain forward-looking statements within the meanings of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 about Navios Holdings., Forward-looking statements are statements that are not historical facts. Such forward-looking statements are based upon the current beliefs and expectations of Navios Holdings' management and are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ from the forward-looking statements. Such risks are more fully discussed in Navios Holdings' filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information set forth herein should be understood in light of such risks. Navios Holdings does not assume any obligation to update the information contained in this conference call. The agenda for today's conference call is as follows. We will begin this morning's conference call with formal remarks from the management team, and after, we will open the call to take questions., Now I turn the call over to Navios Holdings' Chairman and CEO, Mrs. Angeliki Frangou. Angeliki?, Angeliki Frangou, Thank you, Doris, and good morning to all of you joining us on today's call. Given the difficulties associated with the pandemic, I am pleased with the results for the third quarter of 2020. During the third quarter, Navios Holdings reported revenue of $126.2 million and adjusted EBITDA of $60.2 million and adjusted net income of $2.1 million. Although, drybulk demand in the first half of 2020 was hurt by global shutdowns, fiscal stimulus and other policy measures helped global economies rebound in Q3 and continue to rebound for Q4. We believe that this improvement is attributable to food security considerations and new purchasing patterns in the pandemic economy., Consequently, we are optimistic about the expected growth in demand throughout Q4 in 2021. Please turn to Slide 4, as you can see Navios Logistics continue to grow its port business, developing critical infrastructure for transshipping minerals and grains. The company surpassed a $100 million in EBITDA for 2019 and more recently, in July 2020 successfully refinanced in senior notes due in 2022 and Term Loan B during 2021 with a new $500 million senior secured notes issuance., In August 2020, Navios Logistics commenced a process for a potential public offering of Brazilian depository receipts backed by common shares on the B3 exchange in Brazil. Any such offering will be handed to market and other considerations. Navios Partners has about $465 million in contracted revenue and low leverage. Navios Containers, our container entity also has conservative leverage with a 53.9% net debt to book capitalization as of Q3., Navios Acquisition, a tanker company, has benefited through robust market fundamentals earning about $73 million in adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2020, and has a pipeline of about $480 million in long-term contracted revenues. Slide 5 details the pandemic impact on global trade. Obviously, GDP for the first half of 2020 was weak given the global shutdown. However, the economic outlook for 2021 is favorable, where IMF expects global GDP to grow by 5.2%, led mainly by China with an expected GDP growth of 8.2% next year., As a result of the disruption to economic activity, during the first half of 2020, drybulk trade is expected to contract by 2.7% in 2020. However, as economies continue to recover, drybulk trade is projected to increase by 3.9% in 2021. Slide 6 highlights our recent developments. During Q3, we achieved an average time charter rate per day of $20,025 per day for our Capesize vessels, $12,093 for our Panamax vessel and $8,836 for our Ultra Handymax vessels., We have been renewing and expanding our own fleet over the last 12 months. We added eight vessels to our fleet, four vessels were acquired for $96.7 million and four newbuilts were added as bareboat charters. Additionally, we sold seven vessels for $88.7 million in sales proceeds, four of which were sold in Q3 for $65.1 million. Through these transactions, we successfully increased our fleet capacity by 8% and reduced its average age by 13%., As an update to our bond maturities, we have engaged in a collaborative discussions with the holders of our $305 million, 11.25% senior secured notes that are due in August 2022. Owners holding a majority of the principal amount of notes outstanding have agreed to waive the springing maturity subject to an IPO of Navios Logistics to be completed by September 2021., Slide 7, further details our owned fleet renewal and expansion. As previously mentioned, over the last 12 months, we added eight vessels to our fleet with an average age of 4.1 years, while we sold seven vessels with an average age of 13.4 years. This reduced our fleet average age by 13% from 10.7 years in Q3 of 2019 to 9.3 years in Q3 of 2020. Additionally, we were also able to expand our fleet capacity by 8% from 3.4 million deadweight tons in Q3 of 2019 to 3.7 million deadweight tons in Q3 of 2020., Slide 8 highlights our liquidity position. As of September 30, 2020, our net debt to book capitalization was 88.9%, and we have cash of $119.3 million. We have no significant committed shipping growth CapEx., I would like now to turn the call over to Mr. George Achniotis, Navios Holdings' CFO. George?, George Achniotis, Thank you, Angeliki. Please turn to Slide 9 for a review of the Navios Holdings financial highlights for Q3 and the nine months to September 30, 2020. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $60.2 million compared to $89.9 million in Q3 of 2019. EBITDA and net loss for the third quarter were adjusted to exclude $7.7 million net loss from the sale of two vessels, $4.2 million write-off of deferred finance costs at Navios South American Logistics due to the refinancing of its bond and $300,000 impairment incurred in Navios Partners from the sale of one of its vessels., EBITDA and net loss for the third quarter of 2019 were adjusted to exclude $69.8 million due to the deconsolidation of Navios Containers, including $8.1 million of the NMCI EBITDA consolidated in the financial statements of Navios Holdings; $10.6 million impairment of intangible assets in Navios Acquisition and $1.7 million loss on the sale of the vessel., The decrease in adjusted EBITDA is mainly attributable to the lower TCE rate achieved in the quarter compared to the last year and $12.4 million gain from the repurchase of our bonds in 2019. What is not working and reflects the recovery of the market compared to the first half of the year, when the global economy was affected by the pandemic is that the adjusted EBITDA of Q3 is higher than the adjusted EBITDA over the first six months of the year. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $2.1 million compared to $35.6 million in 2019. The decrease is mainly due to the decrease in adjusted EBITDA and a $6.9 million increase in interest expense., Turning to the nine-month results. Adjusted EBITDA for the period was $116.1 million, compared to $199.2 million in 2019. In addition to the items that affected the Q3 results, EBITDA and net loss were adjusted to exclude $20.2 million impairment loss from the sale of four additional vessels and $18.3 million impairment loss of our investment in Navios Europe II, both directly and through Navios Acquisition and Navios Partners. The decrease in adjusted EBITDA was mainly attributable to the decrease in the TCE rate achieved in the period and a $22.5 million higher gain from the repurchase of our bonds in 2019., Adjusted net loss for the first nine months of 2020 was $46.7 million compared to an adjusted net income of $34.5 million in 2019. The decrease was mainly due to the decrease in EBITDA and an $8.9 million increase in interest expense., Moving to Slide 10 and our balance sheet highlights. As of September 30, 2020, the cash balance was about $119 million, compared to about $79 million at the end of December 2019. Senior and ship mortgage notes are about $91 million higher than at year-end, mainly reflecting the new notes issued at Navios South American Logistics. Long-term debt decreased by $73.3 million, mainly due to the repayment of Navios South American Logistics Term Loan B. Over the next slides, I will briefly review our affiliates. Please turn to Slide 11., Navios Holdings owns 18% of Navios Partners. Navios Partners controls a fleet of 55 vessels, 45 drybulk and 10 containerships. NMM also owns about 36% of Navios Containers. Since 2008, we received about $200 million in dividends from NMM., Turning to Slide 12. Navios Holdings owns 29.5% of Navios Acquisition. NNA has a fleet of 47 tankers, including 14 VLCCs and following the dissolution of Navios Europe II, seven containerships that are held for sale. Since 2011, we received about $99 million in dividends from NNA., Moving to Slide 13. Navios Holdings owns about 4% of Navios Containers. NMCI has a fleet of 29 containerships. The company was established in early 2017 to leverage the weakness in the containership sector and scaled up its fleet quickly and efficiently. Since December of 2018, Navios Containers shares have been trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market., Now I will turn the call over to Ioannis Karyotis for his review of the Navios South American Logistics results. Ioannis?, Ioannis Karyotis, Thank you, George. Slide 14 provides an overview of Navios Logistics. Navios Logistics operates three port terminals, which are complemented by our barge fleet for river transportation and product tanker fleet for coastal cabotage trade. Our adjusted EBITDA for the last 12 months was $97.3 million, about three quarters of which was generated from the port segment. In August, we commenced the process for a potential public offering on the B3 stock exchange in Brazil, subject to market conditions and other factors., Last quarter, we agreed to transport 1.5 million tons of iron ore per year for Vetorial for a one-year period and an option to extend for a six-month period. Vale recently notified us that they expect to transit 2.7 million tons of minerals through our port in 2021 compared to approximately 1.2 million tons expected for 2020. As you may know, our contract with Vale guarantees a minimum quantity of 4 million tons annually. However, Vale's notification, Vetorial contract, and other inquiries we are receiving for logistics services are signs of increasing exports of minerals through the Hidrovia River system. All of these should benefit our port terminal and the barge business overall., In September, we announced the acquisition of three pushboats and 18 tank barges for $30 million. The transaction includes a contract of affreightment for transporting a minimum of 1.25 million cubic meters of QL during the period of up to five years. We expect to generate approximately $8 million of annual EBITDA from the transaction. The acquisition will be funded with $15 million equity to be paid at closing and sellers financing of $15 million, bearing interest at a fixed rate of 5% per annum. We expect to close the transaction in the fourth quarter of 2020, subject to customary closing procedures., Please turn to Page 15. In the third quarter of 2020, EBITDA decreased by 13% to $28.3 million from $32.5 million in the same period last year and is adjusted to exclude a non-cash loss on debt extinguishment of $4.2 million, stemming from the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs related to the refinancing of our 2021 and 2022 maturities, with the issuance in July of the new senior secured notes due in 2025., Q3 2020 port segment adjusted EBITDA increased by 5% to $21.7 million. The increase was mainly attributed to higher revenue in the iron ore terminal and income recorded from a certain claim with a customer in the grain terminal., In the barge segment, Q3 2020 adjusted EBITDA decreased to $2.1 million from $6.7 million in the same period last year, mainly because of lower revenue from time charter contracts and increased time charter volumes and operating expenses. The performance of the barge business this year has been affected by extraordinary low water levels in the Hidrovia River system., In our cabotage business, Q3 2020 adjusted EBITDA decreased by 12% to $4.5 million from $5.2 million last year, mainly due to fewer operating days and lower time charter rates., For Q3 2020, net income adjusted for the non-cash loss on debt extinguishment was $6.8 million compared to $14.3 million in the same period last year. This decrease was mainly attributable to lower operating profit and $4.7 million higher interest expenses and finance costs due to the new senior notes., Turning to the financial results for the nine-month period ending September 30, 2020. Revenue decreased 3%, adjusted EBITDA decreased 8% to $77.5 million, and adjusted net income decreased 12% to $25.9 million from $29.3 million in the same period last year., Please turn to Slide 16. Navios Logistics had a strong balance sheet with no significant maturities until 2025. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the third quarter were $84 million compared to $45.6 million at the end of 2019. Net debt to book capitalization was 54%., I would now to turn the call over to Ted Petrone., Ted Petrone, Thank you, Ioannis. Please turn to Slide 17 presents a diversified drybulk fleet, consisting of 49 drybulk vessels, totaling 5.3 million deadweight. 16 Capes, 26 Panamaxes, 5 Supramaxes and 2 Handysize. We continue to be one of the largest U.S.-listed drybulk fleets, established over 65 years ago. The average age of the fleet is eight years, 23% younger than the industry average. Navis Group's total fleet of 195 vessels include 94 drybulk vessels, 55 tankers and 46 container vessels. Navios is a highly diversified public shipping company., Please turn to Slide 19. Q3 saw a jump in the BDI, with a quarterly average settling close to double Q2 at $15.22. The quarter started with nine months high for the BDI in July, but saw a softening in August. Seasonality returned as the BDI reached the year-to-date high on October 6 at 2,097, led by Atlantic iron ore and grain exports – primarily to China, before correcting over the last several weeks down to just over 1,100, its lowest point since mid-June. However, the Chinese economy, which accounts for approximately 40% of global drybulk trade continue to grow on the back of government stimulus, particularly aimed at infrastructure spending., China, according to the IMF, will be the only major economy to grow this year at 1.9%, with further growth of 8.2% expect in 2021. The entire globe continuing to be affected by the pandemic, the IMF projected global GDP contraction at 4.4% for 2020, led by a 5.8% contraction in advanced economies. Governments have put in place unprecedented emergency monitoring fiscal plan to support their economies. In light of this, the IMF projects 5.2% global growth in 2021. The most recent 2020 forecast for drybulk trade is a contraction of 2.7% growth and growth of 3.9% in 2021., Turning to Slide 20. The graph on the left shows that for 2021 drybulk demand for the three major cargoes of iron ore coal and grain is forecast to outpace 2020. This increase is led by coal, which is expected to grow by about 4.7% or 55 million tons. If you look at the graph on the right, net fleet growth is forecasted to be 3.4% this year and only 1.3% in 2021. Net fleet growth is expected to remain low over the next few years as the order book is currently the lowest on record at 6.2% of the fleet, which is less than 6.4% of fleet that are scrapping candidates., Turning to the Slide 21. Despite this pandemic, Chinese iron ore imports are expected to increase by 7.4% in 2022, 1.125 billion tons. Chinese steel mills have reduced their iron ore stockpiles by about 30 million tons between June of 2018 and November of this year, China has set a monthly record for iron ore imports in July at about 110 million tons with the second highest imports coming in September at 106 million tons, as steel production continues to set new records., With the additional availability of iron ore and Q4 shipments from Brazil and Australia to China are expected to match Q3 levels, as steel mills replenish stockpiles, driving demand for Capesize vessels. The Chinese fiscal stimulus and infrastructure spending should support steel production and in turn drive bulk trade going forward., Moving to Slide 22, the combination of the pandemic and the significant drop in the price of oil and gas has resulted in reduced coal trade. Asian coal imports, which account for over 80% of the world's seaborne trade are expected to decrease in 2020 by about 6.5%, but increase by 4.4% in 2021. This reduction has added pressure on the smaller vessels, which has been partially offset by increased demand for grains discussed on the following slide., Turning to Slide 23. Worldwide grain trade has been growing by approximately 5% CAGR since 2008, mainly driven by Asian demand. Overall Asian grain imports are forecast to increase by 9.4% in 2020 and a further 3.3% in 2021. An ever increasing world population food security issues driven by the pandemic as well as increasing protein demand worldwide continue to support the global grain trade. With the pandemic disruptions causing minimal grain trade disruptions, the international grain council projects record shipments of wheat, corn, soybeans for the crop year., Please turn to Slide 24. The current order book stands at only 6.2% of the fleet, which is the lowest on record. New building contracting has collapsed and year-to-date is down by about 60% compared to 2019. With the order book being front-loaded this year and scrapping expected to accelerate as the phaseout of the Vale VLOC fleet, net fleet growth is expected to remain low at about 3.4% for 2020, and only 1.3% in 2021., Turning to Slide 25. Vessels over 20 years of age are about 6.4% of the total fleet, which has now a higher percentage than the previously mentioned record low order book. Scrapping, which started slowly due to the combination of the pandemic lockdown and logistical crude challenges now stands at 13.6 million tons year-to-date, this amount is 70% higher than the full year of 2019 and is about 1.5% of the fleet., In conclusion, positive demand fundamentals due to the restart of economic activity around the world, along with reduced fleet availability caused by the Vale phaseout of its VLOC fleet should provide support to the should provide support to the drybulk market in this continuing effort to navigate through the pandemic storm., This concludes my presentation. I would now like to turn the call over to Angeliki for her final comments. Angeliki?, Angeliki Frangou, Thank you, Ted. This completes our formal presentation of our Q3 results.

These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to those statements regarding our growth opportunities, whether organic growth or strategic acquisitions, future business and financial results relating to timing of and revenues and margins achieved in the Fintec business, the potential size and demands in the markets in which we operate and Micronet's future ability to generate its revenues based on currents leads and pilots., Such forward-looking statements and their implications involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results or performance to differ materially from those projected. The forward-looking statements contained in this presentation are subject to other risks and uncertainties including those discussed in the risk factor section and elsewhere in the company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission., On the call this morning, we have Darren Mercer, Chief Executive Officer and board member of MICT; and Arie Rand, CFO of MICT.

My name is Maury Raycroft and I am one of the Biotech analysts at Jefferies. Thanks for joining us for our London Healthcare Conference. So with great pleasure that I’d like to welcome OPKO and we’ve got a few members from the senior management team from OPKO including Adam Logal, Steve Rubin and Jon Cohen. , So, interesting company that’s become a central player in the COVID diagnostic space and they also have a drug in partnership with Pfizer, which we think could be a large valuable market opportunity that’s moving close to filing for approval. , So, without further ado, I’ll turn it over to the OPKO team to tell you more about the story. Thanks everyone for joining us. , Steve Rubin , Okay. Thank you, Maury. So, hi it’s Steve Rubin. Thank you for joining us. As Maury mentioned, we are a diversified company. We have assets in both our pharma space and in the diagnostic laboratory space. As COVID has been dominating all of our lives now for almost a year, a lot of attention has been given to our laboratory space which has been a leader and an innovator in the space and that’s Jon Cohen leads that effort and I’ll give him most of the time since he is probably more interesting right now, certainly than I am. , But on the pharma side, it is important that it doesn’t get lost. It is a very significant part of our business with significant potential upside. We have marketed pharmaceuticals which is you see is on the left side whereby Rayaldee which is a drug for chronic kidney disease. It’s doing quite well for stage 3 and 4 chronic kidney disease. The growth was getting exciting to us pre-COVID. , Growth has slowed down significantly as patients have stayed at home. Even the number of patients who were adults – are way down, nephrologists weren’t seeing patients. And so, we saw to the net impact. We expect that growth to come back continuing to sell the product and continuing to market the product virtually like every other pharma company out there. , And we expect to see a lot more of that as our partner in Europe Vifor Fresenius has approval in over seven countries expecting to launch that next year and then our partner in Japan JT, Japan Tobacco, which is on our further way to launch. As I’ll go into briefly there, are our expansion studies including one that touches on COVID. , As Maury mentioned, one of the most imminent milestones is our long-acting Growth Hormone. We successfully completed that Phase 3 study. We’ve read that out last year, last October. We have partnered that with Pfizer. , So we ran a worldwide study. We also ran a separate study in Japan and for Europe, we had to do one additional study which you see there, that third bullet, a crossover study which really shows that it has a significant impact on lifestyle. , So really unique to Europe, but you had to show the benefits of a once a week injection versus daily and we show that very successfully. , So, with that and the next slide. So, Somatrogon in quick summary of those that don’t know, it is a once weekly growth hormone. All of the products on the market today are daily products or seven growth hormone products on the market, all daily injections, it’s been that way for 25 years. So we have a once a week and the purpose of our study was to show that is non-inferior and just a safe as what’s currently on the market. , So we actually achieved that. In our case, really the primary endpoint was to measure height velocity after twelve months. We show that our growth velocity was higher in the daily group. And all of our secondary endpoints were also achieved at both six and twelve months of standard deviation, height and height velocity and also showing are safety profiles are similar to the daily. , Same thing in our Japanese study and I already mentioned the crossover study. So, we stratify all the excitement. We expect to file the BLA with the United States this quarter. So, we expect ten months after acceptance of that submission to be on the market in the U.S. if all goes well. And we expect to submit in Europe first quarter of next year, in Japan, first half, later than Europe. , Next slide. So moving now into nephrology and Rayaldee. That is a drug I mentioned for chronic kidney disease. It’s an exciting drug and it’s the only drug in this space, because what it does is, PTH – lowers PTH levels without increasing phosphorous or calcium. , So, they are really been a good way to treat stage 3 and 4 non-dialysis patients with Rayaldee prior to our drug, either they weren’t treated at all or you were treated with a drug using dialysis which are the activated hormones, which tend to actually increase calcium and phosphorous making the drug potentially more dangerous in that treatment at all, because higher PTH levels promote vascular calcification and on lowering the PTH level by increasing their calcification haven’t achieved that even. , Next slide. So, we are also doing a study with our partners in the dialysis market that should open up the market much more to us as - these smaller number of patients, but more focus is getting worldwide to patients on dialysis. , We’ve read our interim data, 44 patients treatment 26 weeks we are showing that even in a stage 5 dialysis, stage 4 lower levels of PTH without increasing serum calcium and phosphorous. We hope to start a more robust Phase 3 – Phase 2/3 early next year., Next slide. As I mentioned before, we are also doing a COVID study. There has been a lot of anecdotal research done on the impact of Rayaldee and whether it has an impact on lessening the severity of COVID, reducing hospitalization. The study was just now authorized in London using an over-the-counter vitamin D. , But our drug need approved in our own studies is more successful than anything over-the-counter to increase - safely increase levels of Vitamin D and you certainly even under these other studies need to have high levels of Vitamin D to have any shock, sudden impact against COVID. So you’ll see this structure of that study. , It’s a 160 patients, non-hospitalized, mild to moderate, randomized in a 1 to 1 basis and observing for 14 days. So we are actively enrolling – at this point, we hope to complete enrollment early next year and it’s a relatively quick study. , Next slide. Real quickly, because I want to turn this over to Jon to talk about our pipeline, we have a series of drugs, pre-clinical that are up we have out there led by probably one of the - our GLP-2 Agonist for short bowel. , We hope to bring that and clear next year and then IGF-1 deficiency is another one we hope to bring into the clinic later in next year. In asthma patients that can’t be treated who have growth hormone issues that cannot be treated with growth hormone replacements as receptors aren’t activated. , So, with that, I am going to turn this over to Jon to give you – bring up to speed on our efforts and how well we’ve been doing in the pie charts to support our physicians out there. Jon? , Jon Cohen, Thanks, Steve. So, let me take you through the high-level on BioReference just to go very quickly. We are running now around 80 sales reps a day, we were at 40,000 pre-COVID. Employees really close to 6,000 in this point. We’ve added almost 3,000 employees since March 13 when COVID hit. Next slide. , And we continue to originally our pre-COVID strategy has been in the target areas for our physicians, strategic partnerships and patient empowerment. , Next slide, and in the physician area, we are a full-service commercial lab serving all 50 states and our areas of concentration continues to be oncology, urology with 4K score and women’s health and then, of course, the fourth is, genetics through GeneDX. , The second vertical is the strategic partnerships. We announced this last year Westchester Medical Center Health System, which is ten hospitals plus where we will be doing the managing the hospital laboratories, doing their reference work and then, moving their employee physician work and others that over to us. , We have some other health systems we are talking to and on the strategic partnership, we have announced some large medical group joint ventures and management structures in addition to our significantly increasing relationship with the kind of care organizations as QNCs, IPOs and several others and then we are going to have a very vigorous prism with this in over 37 states in the country. Next. , The third vertical I mentioned was the – we now have over, well patient access, patients – making the patient experience much better. We currently have over 1 million people who are using our portal and it’s probably over 1.3 million at this point. , We’ve had obviously significantly uptake since COVID-19 where we could get patients their results, we also have had a launch of a direct-to-consumer product which will continue to expand where patients be going online to know their labs directly. , And the third is we are looking at improved ways of significantly improvement in patient experience having their results and actually having their tests access and then the results. Next slide. , The – so let me get to COVID. The update on this, we are running it out of five labs, California, Texas, Maryland, Florida and New Jersey. We are up with some well over 7 million COVID tests that are – could run in the lab today. Our capacity is running – again, our capacity is 70,000, soon to get 100,000. We are running roughly 40,000 to 50,000 a day right now. , Antibodies have been slow for everybody for a variety of reasons. But we will increase the lab based PCR as we move forward within the next several weeks. We’ve had a huge number of partnerships which we’ve announced New York, and Michigan. Florida, we were doing some testing in Texas and I think I mentioned, Michigan and several other cities we have recently announced our partnership – continuing partnership with New York City where we are doing multiple – we are doing at public schools. , We are doing thousands of kids every day and we’ll continue to do that as long as the public schools are open. We’ve done an enormous number – large number of colleges and universities. And then, we are doing much testing for larger employers that what I’ll call large entities, several others which will announce within the next several weeks. , And then, finally, of course, we did the NBA and NHL out of the bubble in Orlando and we’ll continue to do the National Football League all 32 teams at 30 cities, we’ve tested somewhere in the order of close to 700,000 tests for the NFL alone with a remarkably very low – it’s of the novel disease. There is a lot coming on COVID. We are doing pooling as the incidents goes up pooling will fall off some. , We have looked at and validated saliva, although we are not sure what the market demand will or will not be for that. And then, we have – where we’ve announced anyway we will have a home kitting solution available within next – probably several weeks. , In addition, we continue to look at technology as it evolves almost every day in terms of what does point-of-care look like, what does home testing look like, what does antigen look like, et cetera. We have launched a combined COVID Flu IV test. , No one knows what the market will be for that relative to the flu season. It’s – flu season is probably just really beginning to start. Although now it’s been low incidence which has been good for the general public. But more to come on that. , Next slide. Already discussed that and I think that’s where we are relative to just a very high level on COVID. ",,0,0

Elliot Noss, President and Chief Executive Officer, will be responding to your questions. For your convenience, this audio file is also available as a transcript in the investors section of our website, along with our Q3 2020 Financial Results and updated reports., Please note that the following discussion may include forward-looking statements, which, as such, are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risk factors are described in detail in the company's documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on the Forms 10-Q and 10-K. The company urges you to read its securities filings for a full description of the risk factors applicable for its business., Our current approach is pre-recorded management remarks, followed by solicitation of follow-up questions. We are grouping similar questions into categories that we feel are addressing common queries. If your questions reach a certain threshold or volume, we may ask you to schedule a call instead, to ensure we can address the full body of your questions. And if you feel that the recorded answers and/or any direct email you may receive, do not address the meat of your questions, please let us know. Go ahead Mr. Noss.",,1,0

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time I'd like to turn the conference over to Aaron Dalrymple. Please go ahead, sir., Aaron Dalrymple, Thanks. Hello and welcome to the KKR KIO Q3 update call. My name is Aaron Dalrymple and I'm a Director in KKR's Client and Partner Group. I'm hosting the call along with Jeremiah Lane, who is a Portfolio Manager and Co-Head of Research. And John Reed, who's also a Portfolio Manager and Head of Global Trading. We're all based in San Francisco with the U.S. leverage credit team., Before beginning today's call, I have some important disclosures to share. The opinions and forward-looking statements shared in this call are current as of today, November 16, 2020, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions. They do not constitute investment advice or recommendation and are not intended to be a forecast of future events or guarantee of future results., Any performance discussed this past performance, past performance is no guarantee of future results. Close in funds, like all investments are subject to risk. For more information about the fund, please visit our website at kkrfunds.com., Thanks again for joining us today. What I would do is provide a quick market update a summary of Q3, and then we'll go into the Q&A with our portfolio managers, John Reed and Jeremiah Lane., So as we look back on the third quarter, we saw the market continue to inch upward and onward as the feds historic intervention continued to seek to the markets pipes and corporate issuance continued to surge. The S&P 500 returned just under 9% in Q3, IO bonds were up 4.7% and bank loans were up over 4%. And a stunning reversal bank loans experienced a robust rally and were almost flat for the year as the end of September, as returned 24% since the March 23 lows., KIO was also flat year-to-date through September, bouncing up over 25% since the March 23 trough. The bank loan market fully emerged from its winter hibernation in the last six weeks of the quarter, as the asset class outperformed high yield in the month of August and September. The loan market welcome back CLO issuance as demand for AAA increased and spreads tightened, creating a more compelling CLO arbitrage. This created a nice tailwind for the loan market., On the other side of the risk spectrum high yield issuers placed over $120 billion of debt in Q3, which is the highest quarter on record. With funding rates at record lows and capital markets wide open for business, we continue to see borrowers transitioning from bridging their COVID-19 liquidity gaps to extending their maturities at attractive costs., KIO had a strong Q3 and our quarterly performance reflects choices we started to make during the March volatility, when we embraced dispersion that are shying away from it. We lean into this location and utilized our fundamental credit toolbox to assess credits that we believe were overly punished. We identified market themes and disparities as they were forming and also move with agility as the Fed stepped in recognizing nothing was impossible. So maybe that's a good segue to the first question, Jeremiah. Would you mind discussing some of the portfolio changes we made since the start of the pandemic?",That will conclude today's conference. We do thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.,1,0

Today's conference is being recorded., At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Wilkie Colyer. Please go ahead., Wilkie Colyer, Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2020 earnings conference call. My name is Wilkie Colyer, and I'm the Chief Executive Officer of Contango., Joining me this afternoon on the call are Farley Dakan, the Company's President; Chad Roller, the Company's Chief Operating Officer; Joe Grady, the Company's Chief Financial Officer; and Chad McLawhorn, the Company's General Counsel., Hopefully, everyone has had an opportunity to read through this afternoon's press release, including the cautionary statements regarding forward looking information and non-GAAP measures that apply to the statements on this call. Also, I will make reference to a presentation posted to our website in the Events & Presentations tab called Central Oklahoma LOE Reductions. So please pull that up if you'd like to follow along., Last time we spoke with you just a few short weeks ago, we announced our merger with Mid-Con Energy Partners. This merger at scale, substantial long live and low decline of oil reserves, it increases our exposure to oil and what we consider to be an attractive forward strip that rationalizes costs out of the combined entity, enhances liquidity and free cash flow generation as a growth asset to our portfolio in Pine Tree, and requires very little in the way of maintenance capital spending., We were able to structure this transaction in a manner that allows us to keep a simple capital structure comprised of only bank debt and equity, which allows us to maintain optionality as we continue to pursue additional opportunities. Our supportive lending group led by JPMorgan and supportive shareholder base are major competitive advantages in this environment. We continue to be diligent on the head new front., For the balance of this year, we have 71% of our forecasted PDP oil production hedged at $55.12 and 67% of forecasted PDP gas production hedged at $2.57. Next year we are 69% hedged on oil PDP at $51.71 and 58% hedged on gas PDP at $2.49. Recently, we entered into additional 2022 hedges bringing us to 37% hedged on oil PDP at $42.04 through Q3 of 2022 and 65% hedged on gas PDP and $2.59 through Q3 of 2022. Not included in these numbers are the oil engines we will inherit from Mid-Con when we close on that transaction late this year or early next., In terms of results, I think we did a great job of managing business in a tough environment. And if you please open up that slide deck that I mentioned Contango Central Oklahoma LOE Reductions and turn to Slide 3., So Slide 3 executing our business plan, Central Oklahoma year end 2020 preview. We've been able to reduce LOE substantially during this year and lease operating expenses are 48% lower than the previous year prior to taking over operations. So if you look at the top right chart, you'll see in March of 19 when this was owned by White Star, the assets were running at about $4.5 million a month., In October of 2019 about $2.9 million a month and that was the month before we took over operations. Since then we've reduced LOE by 48% to about $1.5 on a go-forward basis. And that's gross, total production expenses like dollar per month., That LOE reduction is expected to result in over 50% of the value increase, or $41.7 million increase in PDP PV-10 for the Central Oklahoma region. By the way, this is the subset of assets that we purchased from White Star as part of those assets., For year-end reserves, we're expecting UCF year-end 2019 reserves were normalized to the same pricing. So viewing the bar chart down at the bottom, year-end '19 UCF at 72.7 that's year-end 19 at basically, today's strip, you see there's some roll-off from production, and that's free cash flow, essentially, some minor revision, but look at that LOE reduction, that's about three times the roll-off of production or free cash flow during that year. So very, very material increase to our reserve base just by going in and cost cutting on these assets., So the White Star acquisition and specifically the subset of assets categorized in Central Oklahoma, is a case study in how we approach inorganic growth. We were able to purchase the asset for a significant discount to PDP at bench strip via 363 sales process. We then hedged that production to mitigate near term price risk., Finally, we were able to cut significant cost out of the field level OpEx without any degradation in operating performance or production, further enhancing returns. While the price tag is lower today than it was at closing, the price paid and actions taken post closing provide a margin of safety against downward price movements., We believe that this process is repeatable, particularly with regard to assets owned by non-natural entities, such as banks, bondholders, or other creditors, which continued to be a focus for us., Our net results came in at or better than we guided to during our last earnings call with production at the top end of guidance and costs plus LOE and G&A, below the low-end of guidance. In short, we executed on the internal things we can control to either add value or at least not detract from value while we continue to look for inorganic opportunities to grow accretively., On that front, the pipeline of opportunities we're evaluating continues to be as strong as it ever has been. It appears to us that bid ask spreads have narrowed as volatility has subsided somewhat in the WTI forward curve. We're seeing almost unprecedented opportunities to add assets to our portfolio, via bank and liquidations, pre and post reorganization combinations, bilateral trades and acquisition of credit securities., Our flexible mandate and multi-basin approach allows us to be value reactive to the best opportunities and our simple capital structure and low leverage both now and in the future give us the ability to play offence at a time when many of our competitors are unable to do so., Thanks for your time this afternoon and for your interest in Contango. With that operator, I will open up the lines for questions.",And that concludes today's presentation. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.,1,1

Sir, you may begin when you're ready., William Sweedler, Thank you for joining our third quarter 2020 earnings call. I'm pleased to join you today. The team and I have been hard at work to best position Sequential for short and long-term success; and I have a few updates I wanted to share on our progress. First, while the pandemic continues to impact the business and the industry overall, we've been fortunate that some of our brands have performed well given the recent tailwinds supporting a healthier, more active, fit lifestyle. The AND1, Gaiam, Spy and Avia brands have proved resilient and have performed well at key retail partners, including Amazon, Kohl's, Walmart and Target., In addition, we continue to explore opportunities across the entire lifestyle and active portfolio to expand our brands into new categories and territories. On a GAAP basis, through continued hard work, managing expenses and working closely with our licensing partners, income from continuing operations for the third quarter 2020 was $4.5 million or $2.71 per diluted share. I'm proud of the team and all of their efforts to deliver our first profitable quarter this year., Second, I wanted to take a moment to recap management changes. I have assumed the role of Executive Chairman and Principal Executive Officer replacing the CEO position going forward. I want to thank former CEO, David Kahn, who recently departed the company. Chad Wagenheim remains President and will continue to work closely with me. I'm also excited to share that Lorraine DiSanto has joined the company as our new Chief Financial Officer. She brings over 30 years of accounting, finance and operational experience. Previously, she was CFO of Herman Miller Group's retail segment and prior to that she served as CFO of Design Within Reach., Dan Hanbridge, he joins me on today's call, is with us through the middle of the month and then will move on to a new role. We are grateful to Dan for stepping into the Interim CFO role and wish him well with his future endeavors. Third, as briefly mentioned earlier, our team continues to closely manage costs and take steps to maximize our liquidity. We recently signed an agreement to immediately exit our remaining lease obligation from our previous corporate headquarters, which results in a significant savings over the next several years., Exiting the office space was the last piece to complete our wind down of the legacy Martha Stewart business vertical. In addition, on the expense front, we have eliminated a few positions tied to the office space and continue to scrutinize all material, non-essential expenses, and to make changes as appropriate. Planning for the worst and hoping for the best in expenses has proved to be a valuable mantra for this team and has resulted in positive profitability. Fourth, as you're aware, late last year, the Board announced that we would be conducting a broad review of strategic alternatives. We continue to actively discuss alternatives with our financial advisor, Stifel, and remain focused on exploring all opportunities that best position the company for long-term success and maximizing shareholder value., And last, we continue to work closely with our lenders, who've been supportive as we manage the business through the pandemic. We recently amended our agreement with our second lien lender and look forward to continuing our relationship together. In closing, we have taken many of the critical steps promised this year to best position Sequential and return it to an asset light brand management company. I'm confident we are on the right path and look forward to keeping you updated., With that, let me turn the call over to Dan to take you through the financials for the third quarter., Dan Hanbridge, Thank you, Bill.

This conference call and webcast is being hosted by Chief Executive Officer, Justin Dye; and Chief Financial Officer, Nancy Huber. Following the presentation, management will take questions submitted via the web link found on Schwazze's Investor Relations Web site and in earnings press release., I would also like to remind you that management's prepared remarks and answers to your submitted questions may contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. The words anticipate, could, enable, estimate, intend, expect, believe, potential, will, should, project and similar expressions, as they relate to Schwazze, are as such, a forward-looking statement., Investors are cautioned that all forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those anticipated by Schwazze at this time. In addition, other remarks are more fully described in Schwazze's public filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which can be reviewed at www.sec.gov, or on the company's Investor Relations Web site., During management's prepared remarks and in answering investor questions, there will also be discussion of potential acquisitions. These acquisitions are conditioned upon the satisfaction or mutual waiver of certain closing conditions, including, but not limited to, regulatory approval relating to all applicable filings and expiration or early termination of any applicable waiting periods; regulatory approval of the Marijuana Enforcement Division and applicable local licensing authority approval; receipt of all material necessary third-party consents and approvals; each party's compliance in all material with the respective obligations under the term sheet; a tax structure that is satisfactory to both the company and the targets; the execution of leases and employment agreements that are mutually acceptable to each party; and the execution of definitive agreements between the respective parties., I would now like to turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Justin Dye., Justin Dye, Good afternoon and thank you for joining us., Today I would like to begin with some thoughts on recent industry news, share brief comments on our quarterly performance and wrap up with a business update. Afterwards, Nancy will review our financial results in greater detail. While there were certainly many takeaways from the recent election, I think it is safe to say that cannabis was a big winner across the board. This election confirmed that cannabis legalization has not only become a popular issue across vastly different regions of the country, but has also become less and less of a partisan issue., Overall, our industry secured wins on election day as voters in five states, Arizona, Mississippi, Montana, New Jersey and South Dakota, legalized medical or recreational cannabis. The number of states with a legal medical cannabis market increased to 36. In the number of states with adult use cannabis increased to 15. With these victories congressional lawmakers in those states will have additional political cover on voting for this issue, while the case for descheduling cannabis has emerged stronger than ever., The incoming administration has expressed support for descheduling and bank reform. And we therefore continue to believe that is only a matter of time before we will see cannabis companies treated like every other legally operating business. Once federal policies change on this front, we will see an immediate yield, a tremendous job growth and tax revenue across the country and likely further medical or recreational legalization in places once thought to be unchangeable., Closer to home, the local Colorado election consisted in 12 municipalities voted on the authorization of cannabis sales or tax issues, or both. Unofficial results show that eight communities approved allowing retail cannabis businesses within their borders. While most of the town's voted on commercial cannabis proposals were small, three were in Metro Denver and tourist destinations, Winter Park and Bueno Vista. These local results coupled with the fact that cannabis was deemed an essential business by Colorado, at the onset of COVID-19 makes me excited about what the future holds for the industry., Moreover, demand in Colorado remains robust and growing. According to the most recent industry analytics, the Colorado cannabis market through August 2020, was $1.4 billion in revenue. This amounts to 80% of all the revenue generated in 2019 and four months still to go in the year., In August alone medical and recreational cannabis sales generated $218 million in revenue, representing that 26% increase from $173 million in August last year, needless to say, we remain encouraged by the growth opportunity throughout the state of Colorado., Now, turning to the business results, we are very pleased with our progress in the third quarter. Excluding the benefit of non-recurring revenue in the prior year period, we substantially grew our top-line and meaningfully narrowed our net loss. This demonstrates our ability to execute and successfully integrate strategically attractive and accretive acquisitions such as Mesa organics and Purplebee's into our operations., Generally speaking, we saw 39% increase in revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2020, compared to prior year's third quarter. The increase can largely be attributed to the revenues associated with growth and success in nutrients business coupled with Mesa Organics acquisition in April 2020. More specifically, we saw a 50% increase in average sales at Mesa Organics and Purplebee's during the three months ending September 30, 2020 compared to the prior quarter., As you've heard me say before at Schwazze, our plans are to continue executing our operating playbook and advance our acquisition strategy by adhering to the rigors of our due diligence process, we will therefore only move forward with transactions that will drive growth, leverage our cost structure and drive value for shareholders., To that point, as I just indicated the acquisition earlier this year of Mesa Organics and its Purplebee's business, which included four retail dispensary locations and an extraction and manufacturing facility that's proven to be an excellent strategic fit and strengthen our third quarter financial results., Throughout the third quarter, our operations team focused at our dispensaries optimizing price and assortment as well as implementing an omni-channel experience for our customers. At the beginning of the third quarter, the field team did a deep dive into our current pricing and product offerings, which resulted in price optimization and new product partnerships., Along with this reviews, specific marketing and merchandising tactics were implemented to bring the most trusted products and experiences to our customers from updating our store look and feel to creating an always on promotions through digital signage, customer takeaways and more, our retail team has created an omni-channel experience for consumers., Purplebee's had a stellar third quarter as well with a focus on process improvements and increased production to match the increase in demand. At the end of the third quarter, we invested in one of the largest distillate machines to continue to increase our production capabilities, which will enable even further capitalization on extraction and manufacturing partnerships., That said, I would be remiss not to remind you that during the fourth quarter, extraction and manufacturing businesses struggle with flower and biomass availability. This is a normal occurrence and we remain confident in our ability to optimize our vendor relationships to meet the increase in demand., By leveraging a strong team coupled with our operational playbook, we're driving growth, productivity and quality throughout our acquisitions. And we're not yet done with what we can accomplish. In fact, we have an unrealized opportunity to improve margins in conjunction with revenue growth. This consists of rethinking our promotional strategy to ensure we're attracting satisfied all customers by refocusing on category coverage. Additionally, we're enhancing our customer service offerings and are in the process of designing and providing comprehensive loyalty programs and omni-channel experiences., At the corporate level, we've also made great headway in building out our talent, processes and technological capabilities to scale the business. A notable highlight in the third quarter is the implementation of a comprehensive ERP system at our retail dispensaries. This new ERP systematically integrates compliance, operations finance, supply chain and will provide valuable data analysis to drive insights and decision-making. This is a major milestone as it serves as one of the primary foundations for our platform and will help guide us as we provide the best experience for our customers., The Mesa Organics transition to the ERP is another step in bringing all business units onto the system. We will continue to integrate our business units and additional acquisitions with the ERP as they come on board through 2021. The implementation of our ERP is very timely, as we're also nearing the completion of our acquisition of 14 Star Buds locations in Colorado, having already received satisfactory proof of funds acknowledgement from Star Buds. Upon the closing of these transactions, Schwazze will become one of the largest and most profitable cannabis companies in Colorado, with full seed to sale operations consisting of 17 dispensaries manufacturing and cultivation., Star Buds is one of the most recognized and successful retail cannabis operators in North America, and is home to a wide selection of strains, concentrates, edibles, tinctures, with best-in-class customer service. Based on the consolidated, unaudited 2019 results, these acquisitions generated approximately $50 million in revenue with a strong EBITDA margin., Notably, the expected pro forma revenue for the combined companies for 2020 will be approximately $90 million and the combined companies will be cashflow positive after the completion of the acquisitions. Once these acquisitions are close, our team will be focused on driving bottom-line growth through implementation of our playbook, process improvement, system implementations and more., Additionally, we will turn our attention to evaluating other opportunities that fit our strategy and providing the most trusted products and experiences for consumers., Finally, I'd like to recognize Nirup Krishnamurthy, who was named Chief Operating Officer and Jeff Garwood, who was appointed to our Board of Directors in the third quarter. Nirup is a seasoned and trusted leader who I know will continue to deliver results and bring a new sophistication to instilling excellence throughout field operations. I have immense confidence in his ability to continue to execute and lead our best-in-class integration and innovation playbook., Jeff is a proven leader in various high growth industries and his passion strategic know-how and creative problem solving will be critical to the success of the seed to sale platform that we're building. We're pleased to have them in their new roles., And now let me turn the call over to our CFO, Nancy Huber. Nancy?, Nancy Huber, Thank you, Justin., For the third quarter revenue was $7.4 million, a 39% increase over the same period last year of $5.3 million. Notably, product sales rose nearly 168%, which can largely be attributable to the revenue associated with the acquisition of Mesa Organics in April 2020., In the year ago quarter, we benefited from nearly $1.8 million in litigation revenue that we view is non-recurring. In addition, as referenced on our last conference call, we refocused professional services and cultivation services expertise into internal projects. This led to a reduction in revenue from our consulting and licensing services during the third quarter, as demonstrated in our financial tables. Still, we feel that this investment in ourselves will pay dividends long into the future, even as it limits top-line contributions from this segment in the near term., Cost of goods and services totaled $4.6 million, compared to $2.8 million in the year ago period. The 67% increase was due primarily to increased sales of products. As a percentage of revenue cost of goods and services increased 11 percentage points to 63% versus 52% in the prior year, third quarter., Gross profit was $2.8 million, compared to $2.6 million for the third quarter last year. Gross profit decreased to 37% of revenues from 48% of revenues during the same period in 2019. However, excluding the $1.8 million in revenue awarded in litigation during the third quarter 2019, gross profit increased by $2 million, while gross profit margin increased by approximately 15% from an estimated 22% gross profit. This was mostly driven by the strength of the Mesa Organics acquisition., Operating expenses were $6.4 million compared to $3.5 million in the same period last year. The increase was primarily attributable to activities related to building infrastructure and ensuring a seamless integration of future acquisitions, while supporting organic growth. These costs consisted of increased SG&A, professional service fees, salaries, benefits and related employment costs, and non-cash stock-based compensation., Net other income totaled $0.7 million, compared to net other expenses of $0.9 million for the third quarter last year. This represented an improvement of $1.6 million. The increase in other income net was primarily due to an unrecognized gain and derivative liabilities, coupled with an unrealized gain on investments., Net loss was $2.9 million, or a loss of $0.07 per share on a basic and diluted weighted average compared to a net loss of $1.8 million, or a loss of $0.05 per share for the year ago period. However, excluding the $1.8 million in revenue awarded in litigation during the third quarter 2019, net loss narrowed significantly on a year-over-year basis, improving approximately $0.03 quarter-over-quarter., We had $3 million classified as cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2020. However, upon the successful acquisition of Star Buds, we believe we will generate positive cash flow from operations and we expect that we will not need to raise additional capital to execute the ongoing business operations. This is because the revenue generated from Star Buds will be sufficient to allow us to execute the current business operations. We look forward to announcing our progress in completing this transaction., As Justin mentioned earlier, we are pleased with our third quarter results in which we substantially grew our top-line and meaningfully narrowed our net loss, excluding the prior quarter litigation revenue, with Mesa Organics and Purplebee's contributing significantly to this accomplishment., Now, I'd like to hand the call back over to Justin for his closing comments., Justin Dye, Thanks, Nancy., Our vision is to be the most admired cannabis company in the world. We're working towards this vision by bringing together experienced, profitable cannabis operators into a single publicly traded company and become a leading vertically integrated platform in the industry. These entities like Mesa Organics, Purplebee's and very soon, Star Buds will be supported by our best-in-class team and the infrastructure we've built to promote their strong performance and operating excellence while driving sustainable EBITDA long-term success., We're working hard every day to make 2020 a milestone year for all of our employees, our stakeholders, our communities, and above all our customers. And I remain energized and excited by what the fourth quarter has in store for Schwazze. Without providing guidance, I'm encouraged to see Mesa Organics on track to outperform the third quarter results. We will work through biomass availability issues that might arise for Purplebee's to ensure we're meeting customer demand and our legacy businesses are expected to have strong results., While we still have a few weeks left of the year, I believe it is safe to say that 2020 will be a foundational year for Schwazze. With the backdrop of a global pandemic Schwazze became a plant touching operation, which is no small feat. Additionally, we have built a streamlined data driven platform in integration playbook that enables our ongoing profitable growth., And finally, we're on the cusp of acquiring another banner brand with the Star Buds Colorado locations, which will make Schwazze one of the first publicly traded vertically integrated cannabis companies in Colorado. I continue to be proud of what our teams have accomplished in the short timeframe. But this was truly just the beginning of this story. As we have said in the past, our pipeline is robust and dynamic. And we will continue our focus on organic and inorganic growth to drive long-term success., Let me thank our investors for their continued support and interest and express my enthusiasm for sharing further updates on our progress as appropriate, including our pending Star Buds acquisition and ongoing growth opportunities., We will now be happy to take your questions.

Today's conference is being recorded. Before I turn the call over to management, I'd like to remind you that management may make forward-looking statements relating to such matters as continued growth prospects for the company, uncertainties regarding market acceptance of products, the impact of competitive products and pricing, industry trends and product and technology initiatives, including products in the development stage, which may not achieve scientific objectives or meet stringent regulatory requirements., Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated in such forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current available information and management's current assumptions, expectations and projections about future events. While management believes that its assumptions, expectations and projections are reasonable in view of currently available information, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements., The company's actual results may differ materially from those discussed on this call for a variety of reasons, including those described in the forward-looking statements and Risk Factors sections of the company's Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2019, which was filed April 3, 2020, and its other filings with the SEC, which are available on the Investor Relations section of Jaguar's website. Except as required by law, Jaguar Health undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements contained in this presentation to reflect new information, future events or otherwise., Additionally, please note that the company supplements its condensed consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis by providing gross sales, non-GAAP EBITDA and non-GAAP reoccurring EBITDA. Jaguar believes the disclosure items on these non-GAAP measures provide investors with additional information that reflects the basis upon which the company's management assesses and operates the business. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be viewed in isolation or as subsidies for GAAP net sales and GAAP net loss and are not substitutes for or superior to measures of financial performance and conformity with GAAP., And now at this time, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Lisa Conte, Jaguar Health's President and Chief Executive Officer.

Good morning to those in the U.S. and good evening to those participants in Asia. Thank you for joining our third quarter 2020 earnings conference call. We are very pleased to announce the 2020 third quarter results with 10.3% year-over-year increase in retail sales. We achieved year-over-year improvement in gross profit of 2.0% for our retail business. This increase was primarily due to an increase in compensation. For our wholesale business, decreased 44.9% in sales compared with the three mounts ended September 30, 2019., The company’s wholesale business is significantly affected as the company is facing a sharp decline in its order quantities in the spread of COVID-19 around the world and the [Indiscernible] economic downturn, where we actively respond to the changes in the external economic environment., During the third quarter, we maintained our focus on developing the retail business through our multi-brand strategy and store network optimization initiative, while improving our wholesale business by upgrading our customer portfolio and improving our accounts receivable., On retail side, our brands continue to attract new customers and existing customers by focusing on design, quality and value. Our inventory management strategy continually improved the balance between inventory turnover and our diligent cost control measures further strengthening the profitability of our business in order to create more visible and accessible locations. We have remodelled and relocated total eight stores during the third quarter of 2020., As of September 30, 2020 we operated a nationwide network of 923 stores compared with 1157 retail stores, as of September 30, 2019. While we see strong demand for our products at our retail stores, we continue to see opportunities in the e-commerce areas., Mobile platforms, such as our La Go Go stores on Tmall and the Dangdang are used as a strategic and effective way for us to drive customer engagement. Encourage cross-channel shopping, reduce out-of-season inventory and create a unique and differentiated customer experience to grow our loyal customer base., And for our wholesale business, the company has enhanced its extensive product development and the supply chain management expertise as well as network of high quality, reliable and cost efficient sourcing channels and manufacturers., In additional our market research center provides our wholesale customers with in-depth research and analysis in the areas, including brand positioning, fashion trends, new material development, and new style design., Going forward, we still continue to focus on enhancing our product development capabilities and optimizing the customer base with our longer term vision of being a leading supply chain solution provider for mid-to-high and apparel brands both in Mainland China and the worldwide., The company’s results of operations could be adversely affected by general conditions in the global economy, including conditions that are outside of its control such as the impact of health and safety concerns from the outbreak of COVID-19. Although China has already begun to recover from the outbreak of COVID-19, the epidemic continues to spread on global scale and there is a risk of epidemic returning to China in the future thereby causing further business interruption., This concludes Mr. Kang’s comments.

23574,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4389064-olympus-corp-ocpnf-on-q2-2021-results-earnings-call-transcript,"Chikashi Takeda - Executive Officer & CFO, Nacho Abia - COO & Executive Officer",[],[],"Chikashi Takeda, Greetings to you. I am Chikashi Takeda, Chief Financial Officer at Olympus. I would like to thank you all for participating in this conference call for the consolidated financial results for the second quarter fiscal 2021. So I am going to ask you to follow the presentation materials, and I'm going to do the same myself. Please turn to Slide 3., First, I would like to explain the changes in our reporting structure. On September 30, Olympus signed a definitive agreement regarding the divestiture of the Imaging Business. Based on IFRS, the Imaging Business will be classified as a discontinued operation from this fiscal year. For that reason, today, I will focus on continuing operations excluding the discontinued operation. Please feel free to refer to the appendix, which includes information about the discontinued operation., Let me now provide an overview of our financial results. Please turn to Slide 4. This slide highlights our financial results for the second quarter fiscal 2021. Although consolidated revenue declined in the first half of the year due to COVID-19, in the second quarter, we saw a recovery trend and year-on-year decline in revenues slowed compared with the first quarter. Operating profit improved significantly, driven by improved revenue and also the lower SG&A expenses owing to activity constraints and strict cost control. The operating from margin was approximately 10% in the first half, improving to approximately 15% in the second quarter alone., Moving to 4-year forecast. We expect revenue to continue its gradual recovery towards the end of the fiscal year with an eventual annual decline of only approximately 8%. Operating profit is expected to reach about approximately ¥60 billion., Regarding SG&A expenses and investments, we are forecasting on the premise that business activities will become more active based on the ongoing recovery trend. Currently, COVID-19 is resurging mainly in Europe and the United States. So we will continue to monitor the situation., Depending on changes in the situation, we will further strengthen cost control and aim to achieve the 4-year forecast. In terms of the bottom line, although we expect to record a loss for the current fiscal year due in part to expenses related to divestiture of the Imaging business, in the interest of maintaining stable shareholder return, we expect an annual dividend of ¥10., I will now explain the consolidated financial results and provide a business review for the second quarter. Please turn to Slide 6. This is an overview of the consolidated financial results. First, I would like to explain the changes in the reporting structure in the profit and loss statement. As shown on the left side, revenue down to profit from continuing operations only list figures for continuing operation and excludes the discontinued operation. These changes have also been presented virtual actively for the results for FY 2020. Consolidated revenue in the first half amounted to the ¥316.5 billion, marking a decline due to COVID-19. After FX adjustment, the decline was 13%., In the middle of the presentation, we show our calculations on the impact. This is based on the assumption that we would have achieved the same level of performance as the previous year, if not for the COVID-19, excluding FX impact, other income and expenses and one-off item. Gross profit, ¥196 billion, and the cost ratio rose due mainly to a decline in factory operation owing to COVID-19, combined with ¥6.0 billion expenses recorded for the voluntary record of endoscopic products, which was disclosed in August., SG&A expenses totaled ¥161.5 billion. In addition to the strict controls we implemented, T&E, sales promotion and other expenses decreased because of inability to do normal activities owing to COVID-19., Operating profit, ¥30.3 billion. While this represents a decline, we managed to achieve an operating margin of approximately 10% in the first half amid a challenging business environment. Looking only at the second quarter, the operating margin was approximately 15%. Profit from continuing operation was ¥25.9 billion, a decline of ¥15.1 billion. Total losses for the first half, including both continuing and discontinued operations was ¥22.7 billion due mainly to a ¥47 billion losses recorded in connection with signing of the definitive agreement on the divestiture of the Imaging Business., Slide 7. The status of monthly revenue. This graph shows the revenue trend by division from January to September 2020, in comparison with previous years as a baseline at 100%. All divisions have continued to recover after hitting the bottom in May. Medical revenue recovered to the previous year's level in September. As for October, according to preliminary data for your reference, both Endoscopic Solutions division and Therapeutic Solutions division returned to growth year-on-year. Meanwhile, in the Scientific Solutions division, year-on-year decline in revenue shrank slightly., Please turn to Slide 8. Now we will go into details about each business segment. First, the Endoscopic Solutions division. Revenue, ¥182 billion, down 10%, excluding FX impact. In the first half, COVID-19 caused restrictions on business activities, such as sales, promotion and training as well as a decrease in the number of procedures and a reduced willingness to invest in CapEx in hospitals. However, year-on-year decline in revenue improved from the first to the second quarters. In particular, Europe grew 2% in the first half and 6% in the second quarter, excluding FX impact, driven by the U.K., where the government has been strengthening its health care system, and Eastern Europe, where we were able to win bids for some large projects., Operating profit was ¥42.1 billion due to SG&A streamlining. Despite recording costs for the voluntary recall of endoscopic products, and this resulted in an operating margin of 24.3%, excluding FX impact., Slide 9. Please turn to this page to see the results from the Therapeutic Solutions division. Revenue, ¥90.9 billion, down 15%, excluding the FX impact. In the first half, COVID-19 caused a decline in the number of procedures and restrictions on sales promotion activities. In response to a recovery in the number of procedures in the second quarter, year-on-year decline in revenue improved markedly from the first quarter to 6%. Performance was particularly strong in Europe, where the growth was 9% in the second quarter., Operating profit was ¥10.2 billion due to a smaller decline in revenue and cost reductions, resulting in an operating margin of 12.3%, excluding FX impact. The operating margin of the second quarter was 18%, excluding FX impact, exceeding the previous year's level., Slide 10. Please take a look at this page for the Scientific Solutions division's revenue, ¥40.3 billion, down 17% excluding FX. In China, sales of industrial microscopes increased, driven in part by demand for 5G-related electronic components and semiconductor markets, resulting in positive growth. However, total revenue declined due to COVID-19. Operating profit was ¥200 million due primarily to declined revenue. Operating margin in the second quarter saw a significant improvement, ending at 10%, excluding FX impact., Next slide, Slide 11. Here, you can see the financial position as of September 30, 2020. Please note that we distinguish line items regarding assets and liabilities for the discontinued operation. Namely assets held for sale and liabilities directly associated with assets held for sale. To ensure a stable business operation in light of the COVID-19 impact and enhanced liquidity in hand, we increased cash and deposits and bonds and loans payable. The equity ratio was 30.4%, down 6.1 percentage points from the end of previous fiscal year due to an increase in liabilities and loans of the first half or the loss of the first half., Slide 12, status of cash flows. Cash flow from operating activities decreased by ¥29.9 billion to ¥37.4 billion, against the backdrop of decline in operating profit, due to COVID-19. Cash flow from investing activities may appear to have decreased considerably but include time deposits of ¥40 billion. Purchase of property, plant and equipment and the capitalization of R&D expenditures both declined, leading to real fresh free cash flow of positive ¥7.2 billion. Cash flow from financing activities rose by ¥91.8 billion to ¥81.2 billion due to funds raised through long-term loans and corporate bonds. As a result, cash and cash equivalents as of September 30 stood at ¥210.5 billion., Next, forecast for the full year fiscal 2021. Please turn to Slide 14, our forecast for the full year. The exchange rates assumed for the forecasts in light of the recent trends in foreign exchange market are ¥106 to the U.S. dollar and ¥122 to the euro. The COVID-19 impact is expected to continue to improve gradually toward the end of the fiscal year. And we forecast that year-on-year decline in revenue for the full year will be limited to approximately 8%. We expect S&G expenses to decrease year-on-year. But looking only at the second half, the expenses are expected to rise. Remote activities and work from home have been established amid continued restrictions on business activities and we will continue to strengthen control of SG&A expenses. However, we assume that activities will become more active in the second half and beyond. In addition, we expect expenses for strengthening our IT infrastructure and QA RA functions in the second half, as well as reduced capitalization of R&D expenditures compared to the previous year. As a result, operating profit is expected to reach approximately ¥60 billion with operating margin of approximately 9%., Total loss of ¥5.5 billion is expected due to the loss associated with the divestiture of the Imaging Business. Despite these difficult forecasts, we expect year-end dividends for fiscal 2021 to be ¥10 per share unchanged from the previous year from the viewpoint of maintaining stable dividends. While we have prepared these forecasts based on circumstances as they stand now, as COVID-19 infections are on the rise, particularly in Europe and the U.S., outlook remains uncertain. We will continue to monitor the COVID-19 impact closely and make appropriate course corrections so that we can respond to changes as they arise., Please turn to Slide 15 for our forecast by business segment. Despite some regional differences, the number of procedures is on a recovery trend in both ESD and TSD, and we expect revenue to decrease approximately 7% for the full year. We expect active operating -- we expect to achieve operating margins of approximately 22% and 11% in ESD and TSD, respectively. With regard to SSD, although we expect business activities to gradually recover from the second half, we believe the recovery will lag behind the Medical Business. For the full year, both revenue and profit will decline, but we still expect to remain in the black., In terms of elimination and corporate, we expect to incur costs to strengthen IT infrastructure and enhance QA/RA functions in the second half and currently forecast around the same level as in the previous year., Lastly, some highlights of the initiatives we are pursuing to transform Olympus into a truly global tech company. Slide 17. In the first half of the year, we steadily implemented corporate reform initiatives. We will continue to move forward with these corporate reform efforts in the second half with executive officers taking a leading role., On the following slides, I will explain our progress in the second quarter. Slide 18. We launched ENDO-AID, an endoscopic CAD platform powered by artificial intelligence that can be equipped in our EVIS X1 next-generation endoscopy system in Europe and some parts of Asia in early November. The platform enables real-time display of automatically detected suspicious regions such as polyps and cancers. This aids in the discovery of lesions and contributes to enhanced quality in endoscopic diagnosis. It is expected to further strengthen our leadership in the GI endoscopy system with over 70% market share by enhancing added value of EVIS X1., Slide 19. We have made progress with 2 initiatives aimed at achieving sustainable growth in the medical business. First, we acquired FH Ortho, a medical device manufacturer in the field of orthopedics. In addition to expanding our product portfolio in this field, the acquisition is aimed at stimulating business growth by distributing our current products via FH ORTHO's existing global distribution channels. We have also developed the first ultrasound device indicated for arthroscopic surgery. Combined with the portfolio gained through this acquisition, we are now better positioned to provide products and solutions in the field of orthopedic minimally invasive surgery., Next, as disclosed today, we started deliberation on reorganizing Olympus Group's sales functions in Japan. To realize sustainable business growth, the reform of our sales distribution structures has become a pressing issue. Moving forward, we aim to reinforce our sales capabilities through flexible rescores assignments and retention of highly capable talent by integrating the domestic sales functions of Olympus Corporation and Olympus Medical Science Sales Corporation for Medical and Scientific Solutions businesses., Slide 20. Starting with this briefing, we will disclose key product catalysts that will drive our future growth in the medical field. First, ESD. This year, we launched the long-awaited EVIS X1 next-generation GI endoscopy system in Europe and some parts of Asia, and an endoscopic CAD platform that can be combined with it in Europe and some parts of Asia. These new products are expected to drive our future growth. Looking further ahead, we are aiming for greater growth with launches in the U.S., the world's largest market and in fast-growing Chinese market., In the U.S., it has been proposed that the recommended age for colonoscopies be lowered to 45, and we believe this will provide a tailwind for Olympus. In the area of surgical endoscopy system, we will launch our flagship VISERA ELITE II endoscopy system in the fast-growing Chinese market. Additionally, with an eye on sustained growth, we are developing a next-generation surgical endoscopy system that is expected to become one of our future growth drivers., Slide 21, TSD. Various therapeutic devices, including ERCP and ESD-related products have contributed to revenue. In the future, we plan to introduce single-use endoscopes as announced in our corporate strategy. Adding single-use endoscopes to our lineup will enable us to build an outstanding product portfolio catering to every scenario in endoscopic medicine and to further bolster our competitive advantages. In the GI endotherapy area, we will continue to expand our lineup in the existing product area to achieve business growth. In the urology area, we are introducing strategic products in keeping with the corporate strategy. Both iTind and SOLTIVE SuperPulsed Laser System are equipped with innovative technologies and have strong growth potential., Additionally, as announced in a recent news release, we have developed protective equipment for endoscopic examinations designed to reduce risks of COVID-19 and other infections. We believe this solution will provide an environment, enable linked medical professionals to carry out endoscopic examination and treatment safely, and will help create an environment in which patients can undergo procedures with peace of mind. Moving forward, we will continue to develop products that provide solutions to address unmet medical needs., Thank you for your attention. Now let us have questions and answers session.",,1,0

My name is Andrzej Matyczynski, and I’m Reading’s Executive Vice President of Global Operations. With me, as usual, are Ellen Cotter, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Gilbert Avanes, our Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer., Before we begin the substance of the call, I will just run through the usual caveats. In accordance with the safe harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, certain matters that will be addressed in this earnings call may constitute forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual performance to be materially different from the performance indicated or implied by such statements. Such risk factors are clearly set out in our SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements., In addition, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures on this call. Reconciliations and definitions of non-GAAP financial measures, which are segment operating income, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, are included in our recently issued 2020 third quarter earnings release on the company’s website. We have adjusted, where applicable, the EBITDA items we believe to be external to our business and not reflective of our cost of doing business or results of operations. Such costs include legal expenses relating to extraordinary litigation and any other items that can be considered nonrecurring in accordance with the two year SEC requirement for determining an item is nonrecurring, infrequent or unusual in nature., We believe adjusted EBITDA is an important supplemental measure of our performance. In today’s call, we also use an industry accepted financial measure called theater-level cash flow, which is theater-level revenue less direct theater-level expenses; and property-level cash flow, which is property-level revenue less direct property-level expenses. Please note that our comments are necessarily summary in nature, and anything we say is qualified by the more detailed disclosure set forth in our Form 10-Q and other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission., So with that behind us, I’ll turn it over to Ellen, who will review the results for the third quarter 2020 and discuss in more detail Reading’s strategies in navigating the COVID-19 pandemic and taking Reading through to the post-COVID era, followed by Gilbert, who will provide a more detailed financial review.

To present the result today, our CFO, Trine Sæther Romuld and the CEO of Icelandic Salmon with us today, Björn Hembre live from the Westfjords in Iceland., As you can see behind me, we are once again presenting the results from InnovaMar, our main office and fantastic harvesting and processing facility. In this way, we get to show you where we belong and where the results is created. It is out here on the coastline right next to the ocean, SalMar produced millions of healthy salmon meals to people all over the world., But before we dive into the results, I would like to give you a great thanks for the efforts our employees are doing every single day. Despite strict restrictions due to the corona pandemic, SalMar has been running as normal, making it possible to send millions of salmon meals across the globe. It is our employees through the entire organization that make it possible for SalMar to again deliver strong results. And this is not a result of something extraordinary, but this is the result of long-term strategic and operational focus, giving us the strong SalMar culture with great passion and ability to find solution in challenging periods. I'm both humbled and proud for the efforts from our employees. We are a fantastic group of people that gives everything for each other and for the salmon., On the highlights, our long-term strategic and operational focus resulting in a good biological and operational performance has once again given us strong results. In Norway, we harvested 35,300 tons in Q3, with an operational EBIT of NOK669 million, with a margin of NOK18.92 per kilo. Including Icelandic Salmon, we harvested 37,100 tons with an operational EBIT of NOK647 million with a margin of NOK17.46 per kilo. Both Central and Northern Norway delivered strong results through solid operation and good biological performance. Despite a demand in quarter with high market uncertainty, Sales and Processing delivered record strong results., As commonly indicated in the previously quarterly presentation, we have increased our MAB capacity to purchase a traffic-light auction and the conversion of eight development licenses on OF1 and already know we have made good use of this as the biological development in the sea has been very good in both Central and Northern Norway., On Iceland, a successful private placement and listing was completed in October. And at the same time, the company has changed name to Icelandic Salmon. Björn will give you more details on this later on. The board recommends a dividend of NOK13 per share., To give you more details, I will now give the word to over CFO, Trine, table is yours.",,1,1
